Selling your product to a customer and receiving payment might not be the end of the sales process. You need to be prepared for situations where customers return products or are unhappy with your service.

To prevent confusion, frustration, and the potential loss of customers, it’s imperative that you have a clear return policy for your retail store. Having a return policy that is set in stone is important for your business as it allows you to standardize your process to better keep track of goods being returned. It can even help you to discover any unusual return patterns or issues with a particular batch of goods..

But before we dive into how to write a return policy for your store and implement a system to handle requests, let's talk about why it's so important to get returns and exchanges right.

## How returns and exchanges impact your business

Getting a return request can be painful both financially and emotionally.

Refunding a customer's order can result in a loss of profitability on orders, and knowing that someone disliked your product can be disheartening for business owners that strongly believe in the benefits of what they sell.

For these reasons, it can be tempting to ignore the reality of returns and exchanges and leave the mounting problem unaddressed.

### The pitfalls of a poorly implemented return policy

Over time, however, customer complaints about your return policy can start to filter onto social media, showing up as comments under your ads or even in Google searches about your business. This is where a poorly implemented returns system starts to negatively affect your overall reputation as a business. If bad sentiment about the buying experience starts to spread online, it is likely you will see a drop in conversion rate.

Processing every return manually and dealing with customers on a case-by-case basis can also be expensive for your business operations and exhausting for customer service employees. If the time and expense to process a return or exchange isn’t monitored and optimized, it can even **prevent you from scaling**  your business.

> At some point, most businesses will need to figure out a solution for returns and exchanges that benefits themselves and their customers.

### The advantages of a customer-centric return policy

Many innovative businesses have recognized that a customer-centric return policy is a powerful marketing tool.

According to  [UPS](https://www.ups.com/us/en/services/knowledge-center/article.page?name=return-shoppers-by-rethinking-your-online-returns&kid=aa3b199e), 68% of shoppers check a website’s return and exchange policy before making a purchase. That’s why many brands now advertise "free", "easy", "no-hassle" returns and exchanges to  **increase conversion rates and purchases**.

A return policy that benefits the customer is often the differentiator between businesses with a strong repeat purchase rate and those that rely on one-time purchases only. As the cost to acquire customers rises, many businesses are looking at how to retain customers and increase their lifetime value.

Although a return or exchange may not make a business profitable on first purchase, the better customer experience is more likely to lead to a higher retention rate and long-term revenue growth.

Lastly, your reputation will benefit most from offering easy returns and exchanges to customers. According to Nielson’s  [Global Trust in Advertising Report](https://www.nielsen.com/content/dam/nielsenglobal/apac/docs/reports/2015/nielsen-global-trust-in-advertising-report-september-2015.pdf), 66% of people surveyed trust consumer opinions posted online. These positive customer reviews and word-of-mouth recommendations about the buying experience will pay off as free marketing for your business that will allow it to thrive in the long-term.



## An Effective Online Return Policy

Many customers prefer to be aware of a store’s return policy before they make their purchase. If an item isn’t the right size or they feel that it’s slightly different from the photos on your website, they want to know their options. Having a return policy that isn’t customer friendly can significantly impact your business and may result in potential customers being turned away by word-of-mouth.

**The following checklist can help you to address all the points that your online returns and refunds policy should include:**

-   Are you prepared to offer a return on all purchases made on your eCommerce store, with a 100 percent refund, if the customer isn’t satisfied? If so, whose responsibility is it to refund the shipping cost?
-   What are your deadlines for accepting returns? Will you have different deadlines depending on the item, or will you use the same criteria for all of your stock?
-   What is the procedure for returns?
-   What is the address for returns; is it the same as your retail store?
-   Are gifts able to be returned or exchanged without a receipt? As mentioned earlier, this is potentially risky due to people trying to turn a profit through fraudulent refunds.
-   Do you have policies in place to prevent the return or refund “on-sale” items?
-   Do items need to be in their original condition and/or in the original packaging? This is an important thing to consider, as items that are not able to be sold as new might cause losses for your business.

With  [around 30 percent of goods purchased online being returned](https://get4tell.com/brick-mortar-retail-black-friday/), it’s important to have a clear and concise return policy so that your business and its goods are protected.




## How to write a return policy

The first step to setting up a system to handle returns and exchanges is formalizing your policy so you can communicate it clearly to your customers. A written return policy allows you to treat all requests the same, and avoid the tendency to handle things on a case-by-case basis, which is often less productive and more expensive.

Policies will vary depending on the logistics of your business and the products you sell, but every policy should cover the following basics:

-   What items can be returned
-   What items can be exchanged
-   What products are "final sale" (non-returnable, non-exchangeable)
-   When things can be returned or exchanged (e.g. 30, 60, 90 days post-purchase)
-   In what condition can items be returned (e.g. lightly worn, with tags still on, etc.)
-   What products can be returned for (store credit, refund, a product of equal value, etc.)
-   How to initiate a return or exchange (e.g. an email address to contact or a web page to visit)

## Where to surface your return policy

It is not enough to have a well-written return and exchange policy—you must also make sure that customers see it before they buy. When talking to a frustrated customer who is trying to return an item marked as final sale, simply telling them it’s their fault for not reading the policy is unlikely to resolve the issue.

Include links to your policy in several hard-to-miss places throughout your website to save time going back-and-forth with customers who did not see the policy. A few key places to list your policy include:

-   Your website footer
-   [FAQ page](https://www.shopify.com/blog/120928069-how-to-create-faq-page)
-   [Product page](https://www.shopify.com/blog/product-page-increase-conversions)
-   Cart
-   Checkout

![chubbies returns and exchanges policy on product page](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/return-exchange1-min.png?format=webp&v=1547480998)

[Chubbies](https://www.chubbiesshorts.com/)  includes a link to their return policy in clear view on the product page.

If the return and exchange policy is clearly outlined on your website, so that it can’t be missed by customers, the right expectations will be set before the purchase is made. There will likely be some customers who are unsatisfied with your store's policy, but hiding the policy in fine-print only leads to more frustration.

## Choosing a service to power your process

Just like having a formal return and exchange policy will help eliminate some of the hours spent on customer service, using the right services for processing returns and exchanges will save you both time and money on the fulfillment and operations side.

#### Shopify Shipping

Shopify has built-in features that allow you to manage returns and exchanges, including the ability to generate [return shipping labels](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/shipping/shopify-shipping/return-labels) for orders. Return labels are “pay on scan”, which means return labels are only charged once they have been used. Shopify merchants benefit from steep  [shipping discounts](https://www.shopify.com/shipping?itcat=blog&itterm=28583329826)  with carriers.

[Return and exchange apps](https://apps.shopify.com/search?q=returns&st_source=blog), like the ones below, make processing returns and exchanges more self-serve for customers by offering a portal where they can make a return request, download a return shipping label, or choose products they want to exchange an item for.

#### Return Magic

Used by over 2,000 ecommerce stores,  [Return Magic](https://apps.shopify.com/returnmagic?itcat=blog&itterm=28583329826)  is a return and exchange solution that easily integrates with your existing logistics system.

Return Magic also uses the Shopify product tags to allow businesses to set up customized rules for returning and exchanging certain products:

![return and exchange app returns magic](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/return-exchange3-min.png?format=webp&v=1547481042)

For businesses that sell a wide variety of products with different return rules, being able to customize your policy with these triggers can save valuable time going back and forth with customers.

Advanced features like these prove that return and exchange rules don’t need to be one-size-fits-all. Special circumstances, like buying during a flash sale, can still be taken into consideration within an automated system.

#### Returnly

[Returnly](https://apps.shopify.com/returnly?itcat=blog&itterm=28583329826)  is one of the larger self-service returns providers for ecommerce stores. The app provides online stores with their own customizable “Returns Center”, which customers can sign into using their order number or email address to access their past purchases and select items they wish to return.

![outdoor voices return center powered by returnly](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/return-exchange4-min.png?format=webp&v=1547481085)

[Outdoor Voices](https://www.outdoorvoices.com/)' return center using the Returnly app.

On the merchant side, Returnly offers the option to purchase pre-paid shipping labels through the app and get access to their shipping rates, or the ability to upload your own shipping labels to send to customers. This customization extends to almost all other aspects of the return flow, where you can decide what products customers can return or exchange, who pays for the shipping label, and whether they are given a store credit or full refund.

One of Returnly’s main differentiators is its  [Instant Refunds](https://returnly.com/credit/)  feature, which offers customers a store credit they can use to reorder before sending back their original purchase. If the customer does not return the product but uses the Instant Refund credit, Returnly covers the cost. By providing an immediate store credit, Returnly found that shoppers were 3 times more likely to purchase again from the store. This feature helps transform returns and exchanges into repeat purchase opportunities for a business.

## Strategies for more profitable returns and exchanges

An unavoidable consequence of offering returns and exchanges to customers is that it isn’t cheap. Although you can cut down on customer service hours with an app, the shipping fees associated with returning a product and restocking it can still threaten your profitability.

However, there are a few ways to minimize your losses while still offering returns and exchanges to customers.

### 1. Turn returns into exchanges

The difference between returns and exchanges is most prominent when looking at profitability. When a customer returns a product for a refund, the business usually loses money on the customer acquisition and return shipping costs, plus they need to refund the customer any profit made on the original order.

With an exchange, the loss is often less detrimental. With strong product margins, offering a replacement product instead of a full refund can keep your business cash flow positive.

A common way to encourage exchanges over returns is by only offering to cover the cost of return shipping if the customer chooses to exchange the product.

![comparison of return or exchange options](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/return-exchange5-min.png?format=webp&v=1547481121)

When presented with the three options above, the choice to get a store credit or new product may be more appealing to those who have not fully sworn off your brand. Convincing customers to give your brand a second chance with a new order can also help improve lifetime value, as they are more likely to come back and purchase again if they are satisfied the second time around.

Chubbies takes this extra value-add for exchanges a step further, by offering an additional $10 in purchase value if customers decide to buy a new product with their return credit:

![chubbies exchange credit](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/return-exchange2-min.png?format=webp&v=1547481174)

By only making the exchange option more valuable, and not penalizing customers who just want to return, Chubbies creates a positive customer experience for everyone, while encouraging more customers to choose exchanges instead of returns.

### 2. Sell product warranties

When a customer chooses to return a product for a refund or exchange, one risk a company often takes on is whether or not they will be able to resell the item. It can sometimes take up to 2 weeks for a product to re-enter stock after a return is initiated, and the time spent in transit and unpacking can often leave it damaged. If the product is expensive, replacing it might not be an affordable option.

For more expensive items, companies may want to consider selling product warranties to customers. Warranties protect businesses against paying to replace damaged products and avoiding disputes over who is to blame.

Warranties can be sold through an app like  [Clyde](https://www.joinclyde.com/), which can be added to your website to put the decision to protect the order back in the customer's hands:

![selling product warranties](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/return-exchange7-min.png?format=webp&v=1547481305)

Warranties like this can also have the potential to unlock a new revenue stream for your business, since the providers often offer a commission on all premiums sold. That way, your customers are protected for a longer term and your business collects a little extra revenue instead of paying for damaged goods.

### 3. Upsell or cross-sell on exchange requests

Although exchanges are usually more profitable than returns, their profitability can still be narrow depending on the product and its margins. If exchanges are still costly, it might be a good idea to look at upselling or cross-selling on exchanges.

When a customer comes back to your website to use their store credit, there is an opportunity to show them new products they did not purchase the first time around that compliment what they’re exchanging for.

Various Shopify apps can be used to show customers related products at checkout.

![upselling through exchanges](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/return-exchange6-min.png?format=webp&v=1547481352)

In cases where customers cover the cost of shipping on an exchanged item, it may make sense to allow them to add more products to their cart to reach a free shipping threshold. Upselling is also possible when you know the reason for the exchange and can make a personalized recommendation for a higher priced item that addresses the specific needs that weren’t satisfied on their first purchase.

For example, if a customer is exchanging a digital camera because they found that it was too heavy, you can recommend a lighter-weight version that might have a higher price point, but resolves the issue they had with their first order.

Looking at every exchange as a new opportunity to increase order value by upselling or cross-selling, the incentive to convert more returns into exchanges becomes clear.

## Making the most of returns and exchanges

No matter how much effort you put into your product and customer experience as you grow your business, chances are you will still encounter a few unsatisfied customers along the way.

How you decide to deal with these unsatisfied customers is an important factor in the staying power of your brand. A company that figures out a relatively painless way to handle return and exchange requests is more likely to retain their customers and have them come back and purchase again or, better yet, tell their friends.

Writing a clear return policy that feeds into a well-thought-out return and exchange system—and regularly optimizing it to make it more efficient—is a powerful way to cut costs and potentially turn a bad customer experience into a net positive outcome for your business.

We do not accept returns of Nordstrom, Nordstrom.com or Nordstrom.ca merchandise at Nordstrom Rack locations. Boutique returns must be processed at the store in which they were purchased.

#### How are my refunds credited?
All refunds will be credited to your original form of payment or a Nordstrom Gift Card. We offer gift receipts to customers when purchasing gifts. When returning a gift, you'll receive your refund only on a Nordstrom Gift Card. If we choose to provide a refund and no record of sale is available, we will ask for personal identification and a return will be provided at current price on a Nordstrom Gift Card. (Gift Cards cannot be redeemed for cash unless required by law.)

-   Items Returned by Mail: If you ordered by credit card, we'll credit your account within 14 business days. This will show on your next statement, depending on the issuing bank and/or billing cycle. If you have requested an exchange, your account will be charged for the new item and credited for the return. If you paid with a Gift Card or Nordstrom Notes, we'll email you an electronic Nordstrom Gift Card. If a credit card was used in combination with a Gift Card or Nordstrom Notes, the merchandise amount charged to the Gift Card or Nordstrom Note may be refunded via an electronic Nordstrom Gift Card.
-   Shipping Charges: Unfortunately, we cannot refund shipping charges.

#### How do I make an international return outside of the U.S. and Canada?  
International Nordstrom.com orders made with Borderfree have a different return process and do not qualify for free returns or merchandise exchanges. For a refund that includes duties, taxes and tariffs, please contact Nordstrom  [customer service](https://nordstrom.custhelp.com/app/ask/incidents.c$sent_queueid/12?jid=j011676-12408&cm_sp=merch-_-services_12408_j011676-_-freelayout_corp_p06_details "customer service")  and ask them to send you a Return Merchandise Authorization form on behalf of Borderfree. Then mail the completed form with your item(s) to Borderfree. If you choose to return an international order directly to Nordstrom, you will receive a refund for the merchandise from Borderfree but not duties, taxes or tariffs. Learn more about  [international returns](https://www.nordstrom.com/c/international-orders#anchor-link-returns-exchanges "international returns").



#### What about returns for purchases at Nordstrom.com?  
Simply  [send your item back](https://secure.nordstrom.com/my-account/blank-return?jid=j011740-12988&cid=00000&cm_sp=merch-_-services_12988_j011740-_-freelayout_corp_p99_info "send your item back")  or bring it to a store near you and we'll do our best to take care of you.



#### Do I need a receipt from my purchase?  
Your receipt or order number helps us locate your purchase the fastest. If you don't have a receipt, we should be able to find the purchase in other ways, but we may ask you for more information so we can better assist with your request. If no record of sale is available and we choose to provide a refund, your personal identification will be required to process the return and the return is provided at current price on a Nordstrom Gift Card.



#### Do you take everything back? 
We'll do our best to take care of you, but from time to time we cannot accommodate a return.



#### Is there a time limit? What if the item is worn?
We will do our best to take care of customers and deal with them fairly; we ask that our customers treat us fairly as well. From time to time we may not accept a return. There are no time limits for returns or exchanges.



#### Why do special-occasion dresses and some designer items have tags that say if the tag is removed the garment cannot be returned?
If customers need to return a special-occasion dress or designer item, we ask that the item be in the same condition as when they received it, with all packaging included and tags still attached. Customers have told us that it's important to them that the special-occasion dresses and designer items they're purchasing have not been worn or used prior to their purchase. Over the years, we have also found that we received a disproportionate number of returns that appeared to have been previously worn in these categories, compared to other categories we sell. To meet our customers' expectations, we implemented a tag or card to help ensure these items are returned in original condition.


#### Are there restocking fees?
No.


#### Why does Nordstrom request my personal identification for a return without a record of sale?
Because of our liberal return philosophy, we have this internal auditing procedure to give us the ability to monitor and investigate refunds and returns without a record of sale.



#### Do you take checks?
Checks will no longer be accepted as payment for merchandise. However, checks will continue to be accepted for payment on accounts.


#### How do you process my return if I paid with PayPal (U.S.)?
If the full amount of your purchase was made with PayPal, your refund will be credited to the same PayPal account. If your PayPal purchase included a Nordstrom Note or Nordstrom Gift Card, your refund will be credited to your PayPal account in separate amounts. If your return is made in store, you'll receive your refund in the form of a Nordstrom Gift Card.

#### Returning an unwanted item?

We get it, sometimes something just doesn't work for you and you want your money back. As long as an item is still in its original condition, we accept returns for free, subject to the rules below, which includes rules around fair use. None of these rules affect your statutory rights.

If you return an item within 28 days of the item being delivered to you or available for collection, we'll give you a full refund by way of the original payment method. If you return an item within 29 and 45 days of the item being delivered to you or available for collection, we'll give you an ASOS gift voucher for the amount equivalent to the price you paid for the item. To find out more about  [returning items between 29 and 45 days](https://www.asos.com/us/customer-care/returns-refunds/what-happens-to-my-refund-if-i-return-between-29-and-45-days/), click here. We aim to refund you within 14 days of receiving the returned item. If you request a refund for an item during the above time frames but you can't return it to us for some reason, please get in touch - but any refund will be at our discretion.

#### After that?

We don't accept returns for unwanted items after the relevant returns period above. If you try to make a return, we may have to send it back to your default delivery address and ask you to cover the delivery costs.

#### What happens to my return if I ordered using Klarna?

If you've placed an order with Pay in 4 Payments with Klarna, you’ll be paying for your order in regular instalments. If you return an item within 28 days of receiving it, we'll give you a full refund.

If you decide to return something within 29 to 45 days of it being received, an ASOS gift voucher will be issued to you instead, and any Klarna instalments will still apply. ASOS has no liability to you for these instalments or any additional charges incurred, so make sure to pay them off in full! To  [find out more about returns with Klarna](https://www.asos.com/us/customer-care/returns-refunds/ive-paid-with-pay-in-4-payments-with-klarna-how-do-returns-work/) click here.

#### Original condition
Hygiene and our customers’ safety is super important, so certain items can’t be returned for refunds including:

-   Face + Body products if opened, used or protective seal is not intact
-   Underwear if the hygiene seal is not intact or any labels have been broken
-   Swimwear if the hygiene seal is not intact or any labels have been broken
-   Pierced jewellery if the seal has been tampered with or is broken.

None of this affects your statutory rights.

Of course, it's fine to try an item on like you would in a shop, but please don't actually wear it. If an item is returned to us damaged, worn or in an unsuitable condition, we won't be able to give you a refund and we may have to send it back to you (and ask you to cover the delivery costs). All items are inspected on return. All returned items should be sent in their original condition and packaging where possible, including tags (e.g., shoes should be returned with the original shoe box).

#### Responsibility
Returned items are your responsibility until they reach us, so make sure they're packed up properly and can't get damaged on the way!

As the parcel remains your responsibility until it arrives back with us, ensure that you get proof of postage in case you need to contact us about your return. We're not responsible for any items that are returned to us by mistake (it happens!). If we're able to locate the items (it's not always possible) and you'd like these returned to you, we may ask you to cover the delivery cost.

#### Fair use
If we notice an unusual pattern of returns activity that doesn't sit right: e.g. we suspect someone is actually wearing their purchases and then returning them, ordering and returning loads - way, waaay more than even the most loyal ASOS customer would order, or the items returned don't match what you ordered - then we might have to deactivate the account and any associated accounts. If this happens to you and you think we've made a mistake, please get in touch with Customer Care and we'll be happy to discuss it with you.

If your account has been deactivated and you need to make a valid return, contact Customer Care. They'll give you a returns label although you'll be responsible for the cost of returning the goods to us.

Please note, we reserve the right to take legal action against you if the items you return don't match what you ordered.

#### Final Sale
Please note, products marked as Final Sale are not eligible for return or refund.

#### Want to exchange an item?

We don't offer exchanges on orders- if you would like a different size or colour, please return your unwanted item and place a new order.

#### Returning a faulty or incorrect item?

If you've received an item which isn't quite right click here for  [more information on faulty products](https://www.asos.com/us/customer-care/order-issues/what-do-i-do-if-i-receive-a-faulty-item-in-my-order/). Or click here for  [more information on incorrect items](https://www.asos.com/us/customer-care/order-issues/ive-received-an-incorrect-item-what-do-i-do/).

#### Did you order from ASOS Marketplace?

If so, please contact the seller directly for return address and instructions.

#### New online returns policy?

Haven't you heard? ASOS is going paperless! You'll no longer receive a paper returns slip with your order- instead, you can create your return through your ASOS account. At the moment you'll need to print a returns label if you want to return, but we're working on ways around this so watch this space!

#### DAMAGED ITEMS

If you receive an item that is damaged, please contact customer service immediately.
[](https://www.revolve.com/returnsexchanges#accordion-warranty)

#### AUTHENTICITY/WARRANTY

REVOLVE only carries merchandise that is authentic, first-run, and purchased directly from the designer. Please be aware that even such products are not entirely free of workmanship errors, including occasional missing threads and similar defects. Products subject to distressing as part of the styling are also subject to increased chance of defect and do tend to wear out faster than normal.

Many products, particularly those with distressed styling, do wear out or develop holes with regular wear-and-tear over time. REVOLVE warranties all products to be free of such problems for the first 90 days from the time of purchase, and will replace or refund your purchase in the event such a problem occurs.

After 90 days, we will attempt to assist with repairs, including providing replacement hardware such as lost buttons or broken snaps to the extent these items or repair services are available from the designer, but we will not provide a complete replacement or refund for an unrepairable product after 90 days unless the designer is willing to replace or reimburse the product at this time.
