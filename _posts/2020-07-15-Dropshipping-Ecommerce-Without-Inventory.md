## Introduction

![Introduction to dropshipping](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/drop1-1024x659.jpg)

For decades, starting a business was a costly and complicated affair. You had to raise sufficient funds all by yourself (or get investors), rent out a brick-and-mortar storefront, and get people in the door. Even today, running a traditional startup takes lots of money, time, and energy.

If you have dreams of [starting a business](https://www.shopify.com/content/5-questions-to-ask-yourself-before-starting-a-business?prev_msid=51732ef6-E0BF-4978-DD31-7A79E83E1382), it’s easy to quickly become discouraged. The upfront cost, time to launch, and legion of details make it seem as if your business will never become established, let alone successful.

Have you felt this way before? Have you gotten your hopes up only to have them crushed?

There is a growing trend among entrepreneurs to dispense with the traditional forms of launching a business. It’s called dropshipping, and it has made me rethink what I once thought was impossible.

Dropshipping places all the power into the hands of the entrepreneur. It provides a rapid and accessible way for any entrepreneur to generate an income and fulfill their dreams of establishing a wildly successful business.

If you feel like running your own business is out of the question, this guide is for you. I know what it’s like to be in your shoes, doubtful that you’ll ever make it, but I’m here to tell you that starting your own dropshipping business is completely realistic.

In my opinion, dropshipping is one of the best ways to start a business today. It’s incredibly easy to start, and you can begin with just a computer and a [little bit of money.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2vq3QmKWqE)

Dropshipping is also an extremely flexible career path, so you can do it as a side hustle or grow it into a full-time job. It’s completely possible to make a living from dropshipping alone, and there are countless entrepreneurs who have proven that.

And while dropshipping won’t make you a millionaire overnight, it can provide a stream of revenue that you can grow. With the right strategies, you might even be able to say goodbye to your day job and make dropshipping your main hustle.

[Stay-at-home parents](https://www.oberlo.com/ebooks/make-money-from-home), college students, office workers, and even retirees can all take advantage of dropshipping. It doesn’t matter how old you are, where you live, or what experience you have.

However, there’s a lot about dropshipping that is still shrouded in mystery. The good information is scattered all around the Internet, and it’s hard to tell what works and what doesn’t. If that’s not problematic enough, a good chunk of that information is outdated.

And sometimes, you might doubt the information you read. You don’t want half-baked theories – you want actionable advice from dropshipping veterans who know their stuff. That kind of advice isn’t always easy to get.

That’s why I’ve created this guide specifically for people like you. People who want to seriously pursue dropshipping but don’t know where to start.

Our goal is to make this a different kind of guide. I don’t approach dropshipping as a get-rich-quick scheme. Instead, I look at dropshipping as a way to strike out on your own while providing value to a particular niche.

I’ve taken everything you need to know about dropshipping and packed it all into this guide. This isn’t just a beginner’s guide, either. I’ll take you past the basics and address what you need to do after you get the ball rolling.

From choosing a niche to creating a digital marketing strategy, I’ve covered it all. You’ll find information on how to incorporate your company, set up a website, and research your competitors.

Finally, I’ll also address some of the problems that you may face. Not sure if that supplier is a scammer? I can help. Don’t know where to get a high quality [logo designed](https://www.oberlo.com/tools/logo-maker)? I’ll help with that too.

If you’ve ever wanted to know all the ins and outs of setting up a dropshipping business, this guide is for you. I’ll break everything down step by step and show you exactly what to do.
## What Is Dropshipping?

![what is dropshipping?](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/drop2-1.jpg)

Before we get any further, it’s important that you have an answer to the question ‘what is dropshipping?’

## What is Dropshipping?

**Dropshipping** is a type of retail fulfillment method. Instead of a store stocking products, it purchases the products from a third-party supplier. The products are then shipped directly to the consumer. Sound familiar? Maybe not, [but 33 percent of online stores](https://blog.3dcart.com/can-dropshipping-be-profitable-check-these-key-statistics) use dropshipping as a fulfillment model.

For the store, this is a mostly hands-off process. The merchant doesn’t have to order inventory or fulfill the orders in any way. Instead, the third-party supplier takes care of the product itself.

Dropshipping is great for entrepreneurs because it doesn’t demand as much as the traditional retail model. You don’t have to open a brick-and-mortar store, pay overhead, and stock products. Instead, you open an online storefront and buy wholesale from suppliers who already have products and warehouse space.

[The merchant is mainly responsible for gaining customers](https://www.shopify.com/guides/dropshipping/understanding-dropshipping?prev_msid=5176e1ff-48A2-467C-B115-D1C77587476D) and processing orders in dropshipping, meaning you’ll effectively be a middleman. Despite this, you’ll reap the lion’s share of the profit by marking up the items you sell. It’s a simple business model and one that can be very rewarding.

Millions of entrepreneurs flock to dropshipping because it requires less hassle and money to get started. That’s probably why you’re interested! And the best news of all? With dropshipping, you can build a business that’s sustainable in the long term right from your laptop.

Of course, there are many drawbacks and advantages, and it’s important that we look at them before you start your own dropshipping ecommerce business. Once you understand the pros and cons of dropshipping, however, learning how to do so effectively will be a breeze.

## Benefits of Dropshipping

**![Benefits of Dropshipping](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Benefits-of-Dropshipping-1024x1024.png)**

**Dropshipping is easy to start.** You don’t need to be a business guru to get started. In fact, you don’t even need any prior business experience! If you take some time to learn the basics, you can get started quickly and learn the rest as you go along.

Dropshipping is so easy because it requires very little from you. You [don’t need a warehouse to store products](https://www.oberlo.com/ecommerce-wiki/warehousing) or a team to help you out. You don’t have to worry about stocking or shipping either. You don’t even have to spend a certain amount of time every day on your store. It’s surprisingly hands-off, especially once you get going.

All of this means that you can start your business _today_. You can start getting everything up and running within a matter of hours.

You _will_ need some foundational knowledge and the right tools and resources, and that’s why we created this guide. By the time you’ve finished it, you’ll be equipped with the knowledge you need to jumpstart your own dropshipping business.

**Dropshipping is easy to grow.** As you scale up, your business model doesn’t have to change very much at all. You’ll have to put more work into sales and marketing as you grow, but your day-to-day will stay more or less the same.

One of the benefits of dropshipping is that the [costs don’t skyrocket when you scale](https://www.oberlo.com/blog/startup-costs-dropshipping). Because of this, it’s easy to keep growing at a pretty fast rate. You can do almost everything by yourself, too, unless you want to assemble a small team at some point.

**Dropshipping doesn’t demand a lot of capital.** Because starting a dropshipping business requires so little, you can get started with minimal funds. You can build an entire business right from your laptop, and you don’t need to make any high-level investments. Even as your business grows, your costs will be fairly low – especially when compared to traditional business expenses.

**Dropshipping is flexible.** This is one of its biggest benefits. You get to [be your own boss and set your own rules](https://www.oberlo.com/blog/what-is-entrepreneurship). It’s by far one of the most flexible careers that anyone can pursue.

You can work from home with little more than a laptop, and you can work at the times that are most convenient for you. This is ideal for entrepreneurs who want a business that works for them. You won’t have to bend over backwards to get things done. Instead, you set your own pace.

Dropshipping is also flexible in that it gives you a lot of room to make decisions that work for you. You can easily list new products whenever you want, and you can adjust your strategies on the fly. If you’re going on vacation, you can automate everything to run while you’re away. You get the idea – the possibilities are limitless.

**Dropshipping is easy to manage.** Since it doesn’t require you to make many commitments, you can manage everything with little hassle. Once you’ve [found suppliers and set everything up](https://www.oberlo.com/blog/dropshipping-suppliers), you’re mostly only responsible for your online storefront.

## **Disadvantages of Dropshipping**

**![Disadvantages of Dropshipping](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Disadvantages-of-Dropshipping-1024x1024.png)**

**Dropshipping has slim margins.** One of the disadvantages of dropshipping is that you should expect low margins initially. That’s not to say it can’t be profitable, but you should be aware that the product margin in some niches might be small.

This issue is especially problematic when you’re dropshipping in a [super-competitive niche](https://www.oberlo.com/blog/how-to-choose-a-niche). When you’re fighting for customers’ attention, you can’t afford to make the kind of profits you want to. If you choose the right niche, you’ll see larger margins. In niches with lower competition, you’ll have better margins, but at some point sales will start to plateau. That’s why dropshipping relies on a fair amount of sales to be profitable.

**Dropshipping can make order processing difficult.** Dropshipping seems straightforward: The customer orders, you process, and your supplier fulfills. And for the most part, it is simple.

However, if you’re sourcing products from multiple suppliers, you might run into some problems. Each of your suppliers might use a different shipping solution, which presents a problem for both you and your customers. Costs can get high, and shipping multiple products can be problematic.

Different suppliers will also have different structures in place for processing and billing. Since you have to manage the interaction with your suppliers, this can get tricky.

**Dropshipping doesn’t give you a lot of control.** One of the disadvantages of dropshipping is that you don’t have much control over certain aspects of the dropshipping process such as stocking products, order fulfillment, and shipping. You have to rely on your suppliers to do everything right and work seamlessly. This lack of control can be off-putting to some entrepreneurs, but it usually isn’t a problem.

This just means that when something goes wrong, it can be tricky to manage. While supplier problems can sometimes cause customer retention issues, you can mitigate them and keep customer churn to an absolute minimum with the right damage control.

**Dropshipping makes** [**customer service**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/customer-service.asp) **more challenging.** This is another problem that happens when orders go wrong or suppliers fail. Because you’re just the storefront and don’t have a lot of control, it can be difficult to sort out orders and handle customer support.

One of the most unfortunate disadvantages of dropshipping is that you have to take the blame when your customers complain. You could be doing everything right and still run into problems if your suppliers have issues.

## **Is Dropshipping for You?**

Because there are both pros and cons of dropshipping, it isn’t for everyone. This is especially true for people who are looking for a get-rich-quick scheme. Even if this isn’t your approach, you still might have one of these fears:

-   “I don’t know if I have enough time to start a business.”
-   “I don’t want to risk getting fired from my day job.”
-   “I don’t want to work so hard on dropshipping that I underperform at my 9-to-5.”

That said, nearly anyone can build a dropshipping business because you can put as much or as little into dropshipping as you want. Here are two common approaches.

## **Is Dropshipping Profitable?**

There are many ways to start and [grow a dropshipping business](https://www.oberlo.com/ebooks/dropshipping/growing-dropshipping-business). Our success stories talk about merchants who have started dropshipping businesses to make a few extra hundred bucks a month, while others have grown multiple six-figure stores. Whether you are looking to start dropshipping as an introduction into ecommerce or a business model to last forever, it is important to understand how dropshipping can be profitable to you.

### **Dropshipping as a Side Hustle**

![best side hustle jobs](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/best-side-hustle-jobs.jpg)

What is dropshipping’s main appeal? Because it’s flexible and it doesn’t demand much, it’s the ideal side job. Many entrepreneurs choose to do dropshipping [on the side](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/293954) while they have a main job that provides steady income. In other words, you don’t have to sacrifice your day job to pursue your dreams of becoming an entrepreneur.

The No. 1 worry here is that your employer will prevent you [from having a side hustle](https://www.oberlo.com/blog/side-hustle), but believe it or not, many companies are fine with it. You’ll want to make sure you’re in the clear by asking about your company’s policy on side businesses and review any non-compete agreements you’ve signed. You also definitely want to ensure there’s no conflict of interest. But if everything checks out, then you’re good to go.

You don’t need to dedicate too much time and energy to dropshipping, meaning you’ll likely be able to take it on without a hitch. Worried that your side hustle will make you underperform? You don’t have to be! You can spend only a couple hours on your business every day and still succeed.

However, it’s important to know your limits. If you regularly work overtime at your day job and struggle to find time for important daily responsibilities, you might not be able to give a dropshipping business the attention it needs. Even though dropshipping doesn’t require a lot, you do need to carve out time in your day for it.

In most cases, it just takes a little bit of [time management and scheduling](https://www.oberlo.com/blog/time-tracker-apps). Plenty of dropshipping retailers manage their main and side jobs easily. You don’t need to sleep three hours a night or skip meals to make it work. You’ll need to figure out a schedule that works for you and stick to it religiously.

### **Dropshipping as a Full-Time Ecommerce Business**

![eCommerce Business](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ecommerce-business-1024x404.png)

One of the benefits of dropshipping is the flexibility. You can make your business as big or as small as you want it to be. Many dropshippers choose to do it on the side, but it’s also a viable career path. If you want to be a full-time dropshipping retailer, you can be!

It’s easy to scale up your business with dropshipping, meaning you can grow your business pretty quickly while keeping costs down. Once you’ve reached customers and gotten enough sales, you can move from dropshipping part-time to full-time. Best of all, you can make this happen at whatever pace you want.

Obviously, this is going to take more work, but the payoff is well worth it. Once you figure out how to dropship effectively, you won’t have to worry about unsteady revenue. A well-established dropshipping ecommerce business operates like clockwork, and it can even feel like you’re generating passive income.

And since it doesn’t take up a lot of time, you could even take on a side hustle while still being a full-time dropshipping retailer! The sky’s the limit.

Maybe you’re rolling your eyes right now at the thought of becoming a full-time dropshipper, but there are thousands of success stories from entrepreneurs who started out right where you are today. It doesn’t take a degree in business or millions in capital to make a living from it.

## **The Dropshipping Process**

Now that we’ve covered what dropshipping _is_, let’s discuss exactly how it _works_. Here’s a step-by-step overview of the entire dropshipping process as well as a look at what the customer experiences (and why it matters).

![the dropshipping process](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/the-dropshipping-process.png)

## **Understanding the Supply Chain**

In this guide, you’ll see the term “[supply chain”](https://www.oberlo.com/ecommerce-wiki/supply) a lot. It sounds like fancy industry lingo, but it simply refers to how a product moves from supplier to customer. We’ll use this to discuss the dropshipping process.

## ![the supply chain process](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/supply-chain.png)

[Image source](https://www.slideshare.net/hari3hhh/e-scm-45891860)

You, the retailer, are just one piece of the puzzle. A successful dropshipping operation relies on multiple parties all working together in sync. The supply chain is exactly that: the coordination of the manufacturer, supplier, and retailer.

The supply chain can be broken down into three basic steps:

**1. The manufacturer creates the products and sells them in bulk to suppliers and wholesalers.**

Let’s say Manufacturer A makes water bottles. After the bottles roll off the production line, they’re sold in bulk to suppliers and wholesalers, who turn around and resell the bottles to retailers.

**2. Suppliers and wholesalers sell the products to retailers.**

A retailer like yourself searches out a supplier for a specific type of product. The retailer and supplier then enter into an agreement to work together.

[![](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image6.png)Image source](https://www.pexels.com/photo/blur-bottle-brand-branding-593099/)

A small note here: While you can buy directly from product manufacturers, it’s often much easier to purchase from suppliers instead. Most manufacturers have minimum purchase requirements that can be rather high, and you’d also have to store, stock, and ship the products.

So, it might seem simpler to buy straight from the manufacturer, but you’ll benefit most from buying from suppliers (and dealing with the slight markup).

Suppliers are also convenient because many of them specialize in a certain niche, so you can easily find the kind of products you need. This also means you can get started selling super quickly.

**3. Retailers sell the products to consumers.**

Suppliers and wholesalers do not sell directly to the public; that’s the retailer’s job. The retailer is the final step between the product and the consumer.

Retailers provide online storefronts from which consumers purchase products. After the wholesaler marks up the product, the retailer marks it up yet again to arrive at the final price. By “markup,” we’re referring to [setting a price](https://help.oberlo.com/product-pricing/how-to-set-prices-for-dropshipped-products?prev_msid=5176e1ff-48A2-467C-B115-D1C77587476D) that covers the cost price of the item and brings you a profit.

That’s it! That’s the entire supply chain from start to finish. It’s a straightforward but crucial concept in business.

You might have noticed that no one specific party was referred to as a dropshipper. That’s because “dropshipper” is not a specific role. Dropshipping is simply the action of shipping products for someone else. Manufacturers, suppliers, and merchants can all technically be dropshippers.

Later in this guide, we’ll cover how to start a _dropshipping retail_ business. In other words, you’ll learn how to become the merchant that purchases products from wholesalers to sell to the public. This could mean you sell via eBay or your own website with an online storefront.

Now that you know what the supply chain looks like, consider what it’s like for the customer.

## **What About Customer Experiences?**

You’ve bought products online hundreds of times before, but you’ve probably never thought about the experience. It’s second nature for consumers. As a customer, you don’t _need_ to think about it, but as a retailer, you absolutely should.

![](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image10-1.png)

[Image source](http://www.ephlux.com/the-new-rule-dont-map-all-your-customers-in-one-journey)

Retailers can learn a lot by thinking about the ideal customer experience of ordering from a retailer. This may seem obvious, but if there are any snags in the customer experience, it could spell trouble for you as a retailer. It’s important to [know what your buyers expect](https://www.oberlo.com/ebooks/get-sales-dropshipping/customer-experience).

Let’s pretend you have a business called Fancy Water Bottles, a site called FancyWaterBottles.com, and a wholesaler called Water Bottles Worldwide. Here’s what the ordering process would look like from the customer’s perspective:

1.  Customer A places an order for a water bottle on FancyWaterBottles.com and immediately receives an email confirmation of the purchase.
2.  After a few hours and up to a couple of days, Customer A receives a notification that their order has shipped. The notification includes tracking information, so Customer A knows exactly where their package is while en route.
3.  Customer A receives the water bottle.

It’s the same process you’ve gone through each time you’ve purchased anything online. This seems basic, but there are two important aspects of this experience.

First, it’s simple. All the customer has to do is order the product and pay for it. Everything else, like an order confirmation email and tracking information, is handed to them on a silver platter.

And that brings us to our second point: convenience. The buying experience is extremely convenient in every way. An online purchase takes just minutes to make, and customers can browse any retailer’s site at their leisure. And if all goes well, the customer won’t even have to interact with anyone. It takes the minimum amount of effort to achieve the desired result of getting a product.

This experience is a lot like buying a water bottle at a big box store and using the self-checkout. It’s a no-fuss process that doesn’t present any problems. This is a big reason why people buy online in the first place, so your storefront has to give your customers that same level of convenience.

Last but not least, the customer should never notice that any other parties besides the retailer are involved. Think about it. When you buy something online, you think, “I bought a water bottle from Fancy Water Bottles.” You don’t consider where the retailer got the product or who might be shipping your order.

To make the process seamless, the customer shouldn’t be aware of all the stops their product makes. The package they receive will have your retail name on it, so as far as the customer is concerned, you fulfilled and shipped the order.

This is how the dropshipping process should ideally look from the customer’s point of view. Now, let’s break down what happens on the other end.

## **What Happens Behind the Scenes**

That’s what the customer sees, but what is dropshipping like behind the scenes?. Here’s an overview of the process:

1.  Customer A places an order for a water bottle on FancyWaterBottles.com and receives an email confirmation of the process. Let’s say the total came to $14.95.  
    Fancy Water Bottles receives the same email confirmation as well as Customer A’s payment. This is usually  [made possible by automated software](https://www.oberlo.com/blog/marketing-automation)  that sends out the confirmation to both buyer and seller.
2.  Fancy Water Bottles sends the order to Water Bottles Worldwide. Typically, a sales representative from Water Bottles Worldwide will receive and process the order. The retailer will then be charged for the purchase.  
    For this example, let’s say Water Bottles Worldwide charges $12.95 for each water bottle. The retailer will pay that amount, and the difference is the profit the retailer will make. In this case, the retailer will net a profit of $2.00.
3.  Water Bottles Worldwide packs up the order.  
    Although the wholesaler ships the product, the package will be addressed from Fancy Water Bottles, and the Fancy Water Bottles name will appear on the invoice and packing slip. (This is so the customer will recognize the retailer’s name on the package.) The wholesaler then sends an invoice and tracking information to the retailer.
4.  The retailer sends along the shipping information to the customer. This finalizes the retailer’s role in the order process.
5.  The customer receives the package and enjoys the water bottle.

That’s the supply chain in action. You can see how the retailer, wholesaler, and manufacturer all have to work together flawlessly. When done right, it’s a smooth process that results in minimal work for everyone involved.

One point that needs to be stressed is that you, the retailer, are responsible only for two steps: sending orders to the supplier and shipment information to the consumer. Sometimes, you’ll have to be responsible for other things like customer support, but if everything goes smoothly, those two steps are the only ones you have to complete.

## Getting Started With Dropshipping

![](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image3-1.png)

All of this sounds like a complicated puzzle, but once you learn how to dropship, it’s a smooth process for everyone involved. You, the dropshipping merchant, can do everything remotely and never even touch a single product!

Remember that you don’t need any business experience to open a dropshipping storefront. It certainly helps, but it’s not necessary. Many budding entrepreneurs don’t ever chase their dreams because they believe they need an MBA or years’ worth of experience. This is not the case. One of the benefits of dropshipping is that you can learn how to dropship as you go.

Better yet, there are numerous resources that make dropshipping easier than ever before. For example, this useful video provides some great advice on getting started. You can have absolutely zero business experience and still easily make a profit. You’ll need to learn the ropes along the way, and it will be challenging at times, but it’s more than worth it.

Now that you understand what dropshipping is, read on to find out what you need to get started!
## What You Need To Start Your Dropshipping Business

![dropshipping business](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/drop3.jpg)

If you’ve gotten this far, you probably want to get started with setting up your own dropshipping business. You’ve seen how easy it can be, and you’re ready for the road ahead. So in this chapter, I’ll tell you what you need to start dropshipping.

Since a dropshipping retail business takes place completely online, you won’t have to spend a whole lot, but you will need to plan well and think ahead.

There are some misconceptions about what one needs to start a successful dropshipping business. Many people will tell you to just find a wholesaler, get a site up, and start selling. But that’s a recipe for disaster. Businesses who take this approach often crash and burn in no time at all.

Simply put, there are right and wrong ways to approach your dropshipping business. If you’re trying to make money fast, your business will suffer. That’s why I advocate a different perspective: the idea that **dropshipping retailers should meet the needs of customers in a specific niche.**

Naturally, you’ll need certain tools and resources to get started, but you’ll also need to learn new concepts and develop the right mindset. You’ll need to put tons of thought into how you want to set up your business and what goals you want to achieve.

With that in mind, let’s go over the must-haves for a successful dropshipping business. I’ll delve into these in devoted chapters, but right now let’s take a look at the big picture.

## Value

Before you go looking for suppliers (and before you even choose a niche), you need to focus on value. This is something I’m going to bring up regularly throughout this guide because it’s such a crucial principle.

![value proposition](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/value-proposition--625x470.png)

[Source](https://masterful-marketing.com/value-proposition/)

Frankly, many dropshipping businesses don’t care about value. Dropshipping has gained a somewhat bad reputation because many dropshipping retailers are just trying to outsell their competitors by offering [cheaply made products.](https://www.oberlo.com/blog/avoid-counterfeit-goods-aliexpress) To make matters worse, dropshippers will sometimes resort to shady tactics to sell and one-up the competition. All of this has led people to believe that it’s a scammy practice, but that couldn’t be further from the truth.

A dropshipping business is just like any other business, so it makes sense that you should approach dropshipping the way you’d approach another kind of business. Sadly, many individuals overlook this. Ultimately,  [people quit dropshipping](https://www.oberlo.com/videos/why-people-quit-dropshipping)  because they don’t take the time to build a sturdy foundation.

Thinking about value will help you start up a successful dropshipping business. It’ll help you stand out from your competitors, and more importantly, you’ll be focusing on the single most important aspect of any business, dropshipping or otherwise.

The best way to focus on value is to build it into your dropshipping business from the start. Everything you do should add value to your audience in some way.

If value is your number one priority, you’ll be much more likely to get consumers’ attention, and your business will last much longer than other dropshippers who just want to make a quick buck.

Wondering _how_ you can make value your priority? Well, there are some important questions you need to ask yourself before doing anything else:

-   Who are you trying to help? What type of people do you want to reach, and what do they want?
-   What niche(s) could you add value to?
-   What kinds of products do customers in my niche want?
-   How can I put my customers first?

In short, the best way to provide value is to listen to your potential customers, find out what they want, and then give it to them. Your job is to give customers the best possible experience.

Keeping value a priority has tangible benefits for your dropshipping business. Having this attitude will help you:

-   Acquire and retain customers
-   Grow a loyal customer base
-   Stand out from your competitors
-   Make your business unique and trustworthy

Throughout this guide, you’ll notice a consistent theme of adding value. It’s important that you don’t lose sight of this goal as you go on. It’s easy to get caught up in the rush of starting a business, but you have to remember to always keep value first.

## The Right Niche

Have you ever wondered why so many dropshipping businesses are unsuccessful?

Sometimes it can seem like retailers are dropping like flies, and it can be discouraging at first. But there are common mistakes that tons of dropshippers make.

One of the biggest  [dropshipping failures](https://www.oberlo.com/videos/six-figure-dropshippers-share-their-biggest-dropshipping-failures)  is choosing the wrong niche. That’s right – one of the most common reason dropshipping retailers fail is because they chose the wrong niche.

To understand why this happens, let’s consider some common dropshipping niches:

-   Phone accessories (especially cases)
-   Clothing
-   Beauty/cosmetics products
-   Books
-   Entertainment (e.g., movies, music, etc.)

You’ve probably seen a thousand different dropshipping businesses that offer at least one of these types of items.

The problem? These niches are all _extremely_ high competition.

Think about dropshipping retailers that sell phone cases. If you want to buy phone cases online, you can choose from thousands and thousands of businesses. From Etsy to eBay and everywhere in between, there are too many phone case stores to count.

If you want to sell phone cases, you’ll have to go up against dropshipping stores who have been doing this for years. You’ll have to cut through the noise, advertise like crazy, and hope people find you (and choose to buy from you).

More importantly, it’s hard to add real value to a niche like that. When you dropship, you’re often choosing from the same products your competitors buy. That means you have to take an entirely different approach to adding value.

The dropshipping niche you choose is a huge determining factor for value. If you choose a less popular niche, there’s a good possibility you can step in and fill a need in that niche. But if you choose a niche that’s super crowded, it’s going to be almost impossible to differentiate yourself from your competitors (who have been around longer and are more popular).

Of course, choosing the right niche is a crucial decision for any business, but many dropshipping businesses seem to completely overlook it. Most dropshippers assume that they can just choose a hot trend and jump on the bandwagon.

When you’re choosing a niche, there’s a lot to consider. That’s why I’ve dedicated  [Chapter 4](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/ebooks/dropshipping/finding-niche-products?prev_msid=5177c435-23EC-4B8A-1999-B332032A284F)  to helping you settle on a dropshipping niche.

## The Right Products

Once you’ve settled on a niche, it’s time to take the next step and think about the kinds of products your store will offer.

It’s not as simple as choosing dropshipping products that seem popular. You need to be picky about your products. In order to establish a successful dropshipping business, you need to select your products carefully and base your choices on what your audience wants and needs.

![dropshipping product selection](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/product-selection-975x620.png)

Again, you have to think about value. While looking at [bestselling products](https://www.oberlo.com/blog/unique-dropshipping-products-sell-2018) is a good place to start, it’s not the be-all, end-all of product selection. You have to make sure the products you offer have significant value to your customer base. Many popular dropshipping products are only popular for a while. If you choose products that have lasting value, you’ll be able to offer products that can stand the test of time.

At the same time, you want to analyze product trends and use them to your advantage. If certain products have boomed over the last few months, they’ll probably sell very well. Later in this guide, I’ll show you how to analyze trends and figure out which products will be best for you.

Once you start dropshipping products, you might decide to change the items you offer according to your audience’s needs. Still, aim to start off strong and establish a line of products that will do well for you.

Finally, bear in mind that  [product selection](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/ebooks/make-money-from-home/products-to-sell-from-home?prev_msid=5177c435-23EC-4B8A-1999-B332032A284F)  is an ongoing process. You need to stay up-to-date with trends in your niche and change up your storefront accordingly. That’s why I’m sharing specific strategies for product research. Your goal is to use these strategies on a regular basis to optimize your store for sales and overall performance.

## An Incorporated Business

Most suppliers and wholesalers require any business they work with to be legally incorporated. In fact, if you’re not incorporated, most wholesalers won’t show you their pricing or other details. That’s how important it is.

Remember, a dropshipping business is still a business. It should follow many of the same rules as a traditional business. Dropshipping may take place online, but it still needs to be conducted according to the law.

If you don’t follow these important rules, you’ll run into problems. The bottom line: it’s best to be incorporated before you even reach out to suppliers.

![benefits of incorporating](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/incorporation-benefits.png)

[Image source](https://legallogik.com/incorporation-top-advantages/)

I’ll cover this in more detail in Chapter 6, but for now, just remember that at some point, you’re going to have to take the time to make sure your business is legal and good to go.

## Supplier(s)

As you might have guessed, getting suppliers and wholesalers on board is an absolute necessity. Since you’ll get your [products directly from suppliers](https://www.oberlo.com/blog/dropshipping-suppliers), you obviously want to work with companies that have a great track record and solid communication.

You’ll need to put some serious time and consideration into this part of the process. You don’t want to choose the first wholesaler you see, and you also don’t want to blindly go with the most popular suppliers you can find with a Google search.

You’ll have to weigh your options, compare prices, and make sure you have access to the dropshipping products you need. There are also certain protocols you’ll need to follow when contacting wholesalers and making arrangements with them.

Chapter 9 is entirely devoted to helping you find suppliers, so if this seems intimidating, don’t worry. I’ll be addressing everything you need to know about choosing the right suppliers for your business.

## A Game Plan

There’s one last major ingredient you need: a game plan. By ‘game plan’, I mean a vision for your business and actionable steps to make that vision happen.

You don’t need to plan out every little thing you’re going to do, but you should have an idea of how you’re going to approach your new business. You want to get a sense of the big picture and then figure out the smaller details. It never hurts to be too thorough.

Here are some areas to consider:

-   Getting sales
-   Taking a certain angle in your niche
-   Digital marketing strategies
-   Optimizing your online store

This is also a good time to ask the tough questions so you can prepare yourself for them. For example, what if you’re getting nowhere after 6 months? 1 year? It’s not fun to think about these kinds of things, but doing so might save you from utter failure.

Another question you might want to ask yourself is, “Ideally, where do I want my business to go over the next X years?” This is a more general  [dropshipping FAQ](https://www.oberlo.com/podcast/dropshipping-questions-answers)  that can help guide your vision.

If you know exactly what you want, you can take steps toward making it happen. The more specific you get, the better. It might help you to draft up a business plan or even a flowchart that traces the ideal trajectory of your business.

## Getting Started

So far, you haven’t been able to actually do anything. I know it’s not fun, but it’s how every legendary business started out.

But now, that’s all going to change. You’ll soon be able to put the knowledge and strategies you’ve developed to work.

By now, you should know:

-   The niches you’re interested in
-   The types of products you want to offer
-   Your plan for your store’s future

Now you can start setting up your business in earnest. First, I’ll dive into selecting a niche for your store.
## Choosing Your Niche

![niche products](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/notebook-man-working-people-woman-notepad-764658-pxhere.com_.jpg)

So you’ve decided to start a dropshipping retail business, and you’re wondering what to do first. The first big decision you have to make is [which niche products to offer](https://www.oberlo.com/blog/dropshipping-niches). The best way to ensure that your business is successful is to think carefully about which niche is the best dropshipping niche for you.

Settling on a niche is a bit more complicated than it seems. For dropshipping, you want to pick a niche that’s profitable and that doesn’t have insane levels of competition. That’s the basic formula. The right research will help you do this, but it will take some time.

If you already have a niche you’re eyeballing, you need to analyze that niche from a retailer’s perspective and consider how successful you’d actually be in that niche. On the other hand, if you have no niche in mind, that’s fine too. I’ll be covering every step from researching the top dropshipping niches to narrowing down your options.

I know it’s tempting to find the hottest new niche and spend an afternoon setting up a store. In fact, that’s what a large number of dropshippers do. They see which niche products are exploding and blindly hop on the bandwagon.

However, this is not a good method. You might achieve runaway success for a while, but after that ends, you’ll probably watch your business fall apart. This happens to almost every entrepreneur who capitalizes on the latest craze. A business model like that simply isn’t meant to last, and my goal is to help you create a sustainable dropshipping retail career.

**If you want to turn dropshipping into a steadily flowing stream of income, you’ll need to choose your niche carefully.** In fact, niche selection is one of the most important business decisions you’ll ever make. It sets the stage for everything else to follow.

Think about it. The niche you choose will influence:

-   What products you offer
-   How much you sell
-   Which suppliers you work with
-   What marketing strategies you use
-   How successful your business will ultimately be

It’s a big decision, and it’s not one to be taken lightly. Too often, dropshippers realize the niche they chose isn’t working out, and they have to go back square one. That can be a colossal waste of time, money, and other important resources, especially if you’ve been at it for a while.

The more thought you put into selecting a niche, the sturdier your business will be. You won’t doubt yourself a few months down the road. And that’s what this chapter is all about: helping you find the best dropshipping niche for your business.

I find that a lot of success with dropshipping comes from asking the right questions. So without further ado, let’s look at the most important questions you need to ask yourself when selecting a niche.

## How to Evaluate Dropshipping Niche Ideas

Choosing a niche can be confusing. There are millions of niches, so it’s tricky to know which ones are viable. To make matters worse, many of those niches have established businesses you’d be competing directly against. It’s the million dollar question: how do you break into a profitable niche as a newbie?

When you’re thinking about this, it may seem like every niche is saturated, but that’s not true. There are niches that still have a genuine need for product purchasing options. Some niches haven’t been tapped into heavily, while other niches have product-based needs that your store could help with.

However, it can be difficult to know where to just _start_ looking for optimal dropshipping niche ideas. Where do you look? _How_ do you look? What criteria should you use for finding good niches? To the beginner, these are daunting questions.

There’s a reason it’s so intimidating: niche evaluation is really a specialized field of its own. You could spend months choosing the best niche, but that’s not exactly practical for dropshipping. Luckily, there are tactics you can use to choose a great niche in a matter of weeks (or even days, though you shouldn’t rush it).

Basically, you have to determine if a niche is suitable based on the following:

-   The level of competition
-   The demand for physical niche products
-   The long term forecast of niche popularity

The best dropshipping niche would have low to medium competition and high demand. It would also stay popular indefinitely. Of course, niches like this don’t exist, so you have to figure out how to balance these criteria. The right balance for you might not be right for another entrepreneur, so you have to think critically about which elements are most important to you.

Here’s a simple two-step process you can use to start your search for a niche. It revolves around the idea that some niches are better for physical products than others. Once you’ve found those niches, you can ask other questions to help you narrow it down further.

## Step 1: Search for trending or low-Competition niches.

Begin by doing a simple Google search for ‘trending niches’ or ‘low-competition niches’. You’ll have to narrow your search a lot, but this is a basic start. You’re just taking baby steps for now and getting a very big picture sense of the various dropshipping niche ideas out there.

![finding niche products](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/niche-products.png)

Typically when you search for trending niches, you’ll find lists of niche products that are currently popular or predicted to become popular in the coming months. These have a lot of potential, but they may also get crowded.

Low-competition niches, by definition, won’t be too crowded, but this could limit how much you can earn. Niches with super-low levels of competition will usually have smaller audiences, and that translates into a smaller customer base for your business.

In addition, some niches won’t be right for dropshipping, so you’ll want to make sure you’re looking at product-based niches. (For example, explainer videos have surged in popularity, but an explainer video is not a physical product, so dropshipping is out of the question.)

When you’re looking at niches, you want to make sure they meet a few important criteria. You could do this later, but I feel it’s best to filter your results early on. Here are some questions to ask:

### Is This a Product-Based Niche?

First, it’s essential to make sure the niche you’re considering has a decent amount of physical products associated with it. Some niches, like explainer videos, have no product-based needs at all. Other niches do have product-based needs but not many. For example, niches that mostly deal with digital products, like cryptocurrency, aren’t all that practical for dropshipping because of the low amount of physical products available.

As you do more research, you’ll see that certain niches are inherently more plentiful with products than others. For example, clothing is better than time management for dropshipping because it offers more product variety.

The more niche products you can offer, the better. You don’t want to sell everything under the sun, but you do want to have a good amount of variety. That’s why a niche that has lots of products is great for dropshipping. It gives you a ton of room for growth and expansion.

This can be tough because with a high amount of product variety, there’s often a high level of competition. However, if you look outside of the most popular niches, you should be able to find some niches that aren’t too competitive yet still have a good amount of product variety.

Last but not least, make sure the products are easily accessible for both you and your customers. For example, custom made items are generally more difficult to dropship, and they won’t give you the best profit margins. You also want to consider the fact that the more obscure niche products won’t have a broad appeal. As a general rule, a product that appeals to a wide group of people within the niche is a good product to dropship.

### How Popular Is This Niche?

Ideally, you’re after a niche that’s not _too_ popular. You want to choose a niche that has sufficient interest and product demand to sustain a retail business. Often, you will have to compromise, and it’s a matter of knowing _how_ to compromise.

When conducting niche research, if you can tell right away that a niche is incredibly popular, be warned that it may be difficult to break into. As a new dropshipper, you’ll face the challenge of getting your brand seen, and it’s much easier in a lower competition niche (even though bigger niches may be tempting and seem easy).

![low competition niche](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/low-comp-niche.png)

[Image source](https://www.nichepursuits.com/low-competition-keywords-rank-google/)

The niche evaluation steps in this chapter will help you find a good niche that’s not too empty or too crowded. And in Chapter 5, when you research products, you’ll get an even more detailed idea of how popular your chosen niche is.

### Is This Niche Just the Result of a Passing Fad?

Every year, there are several handfuls of trends that come and go in a matter of months (sometimes weeks). Businesses pop up left and right to capitalize on these trends, but when the trends die, so do the businesses.

At the same time, a new trend could become the next big niche. Lately, niche products like drones, fidget spinners, and virtual reality gear have become hugely popular in a matter of months, and the dropshippers in these niches have scored big. However, there’s always a risk involved with going with the coolest new niche, so it is usually safer to choose a niche that’s been around for a while.

If you find a niche that’s relatively new, it might not be a good idea to pursue it, but you have to evaluate this on a case-by-case basis. As a rule of thumb, you should give preference to niches with established (or at least devoted) communities.

### Am I Too Passionate About This Niche?

I know this seems like a weird question because usually passion is a good thing. But in this case, too much passion can actually be detrimental to your dropshipping career.

Let’s say you have a lifelong love of lava lamps. That passion is great, but it won’t necessarily translate into sales. You can’t build a dropshipping career on lava lamps because they’re very niche and not big sellers. You can have all the passion in the world for lava lamps, but you can’t magically turn them into a sustainable career.

In addition, passion can often blind you to the harsh truths that come with operating a business. Maybe certain niche products aren’t selling well but you want to keep it around anyway because you like it and believe it will do well. So while it seems like having lots of passion is good, it’s usually ideal to have a fair amount of detachment from the niche products you choose.

That’s not to say you can’t pick your favorite niche for dropshipping. If you’re able to objectively evaluate your niche and if it looks like a good choice, go for it. Getting an outside view helps a lot with this decision.

You need to step back from what you think of a niche and look at it through an entrepreneurial lens. You’re going to have to make business decisions based on facts and figures, and you need to be able to do that easily without being too emotionally or personally invested.

### Can I Actually Add Value to This Niche?

This is another question few dropshippers ask. Most people think that opening up a store _is_ a form of adding value, but that’s not always true.

If you’re opening a store that’s basically a carbon copy of an existing store, you’re not doing anything new or unique. You have very little to differentiate yourself from your competitors.

![adding value](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/value.png)

But the most problematic thing is that some entrepreneurs who start dropshipping businesses like this don’t _want_ to provide value. These are the get-rich-quick schemers who see dropshipping as a means to an end. Customers can see right through this, and it’s also a poor attitude to have in general.

It’s easy to tell if a business is earnestly trying to provide value or just trying to make a quick buck. People are more likely to support businesses that give them value. By putting your customers first and emphasizing value, you’ll be creating the best conditions for your business to grow.

If you don’t focus on value, you’ll have a harder time selling.

That’s why you need to be honest with yourself here. Can you _really_ add value to the niche you’re considering? Can you offer something different to customers who have a bunch of retailers to choose from?

One of the best ways to evaluate this is by looking at retailers who are already in the niche, and that’s what the second step is all about. However, this is a question you should start thinking about now.

If you feel like you can’t take an interesting angle or do something differently, reconsider the niche (as painful as that may be). Rather revise your niche than choose one that won’t work for you.

## Step 2: Search for existing retailers.

Next, spend some time researching the retailers who are already established in the niche. For now, simple Google searches will suffice. Use various combinations and product keywords to see who’s selling what, and pay attention to who the big players are (i.e., the retailers you see over and over again).

This step really deserves an analytical approach if you want to get the most out of it. I recommend keeping a list of the retailers you find and making sure to record details like their name, website, and social handles. (A spreadsheet is great for this.)

Don’t just look at the most popular stores – search high and low, and look at everything that’s out there. There may be smaller retailers who are becoming popular and doing something unique, and analyzing these stores is just as important as analyzing the big names in your niche.

And don’t be afraid to take extensive notes on what you see. Often it’s the little things that matter, and scrutinizing details can help you understand why some retailers’ strategies are so successful. Once you understand what they’re doing, you can break it down and use the knowledge for yourself.

Once you’ve gotten a list of 5-10 retailers, take this opportunity to also look at each store’s online presence. You don’t need to do extensive research at this point. Just take a look at each retailer’s site and social media accounts to get a rough idea of their strategies. See what kinds of content they post, how they engage customers, and when they mention their products.

If you can’t find many retailers, that could be a good or a bad sign. Low competition is great, but you still need to have a sizeable audience to buy your niche products. This means that if you barely find any retailers, you’ll need to look at pages and online communities dedicated to the niche. Lots of activity is good, but low activity means this niche is probably a bad choice. It could also mean that this niche doesn’t have a huge need for physical products.

This step doesn’t need to determine the niche you choose, but it should give you an idea of what you’re dealing with. It will clue you into how popular the niche is and how much value you could give customers. Again, don’t be afraid to spend a lot of time on this step.

When you’re finished, you should have a list of niches that are practical for dropshipping, along with the details of retailers who are already in those niches.

### Is It Better to Choose a Super Saturated or Super Unsaturated Niche?

[The perfect niche](https://www.oberlo.com/blog/what-should-you-sell-online) would have low competition but a large audience. In the real world, that rarely happens. The typical niche is moderately saturated, with a reasonable number of retailers and an audience that’s not too big or too small.

But what if you’re stuck between choosing a super-saturated or a super-unsaturated niche? That’s a tough decision. It’s important to note that you probably won’t have to choose between these two extremely different options. Most of the time, you’ll find niches that aren’t completely saturated or unsaturated.

If those _are_ your only choices, you might want to go back to the drawing board and consider other dropshipping niche ideas. It’s hard to be profitable in a niche that has a huge amount of competition, but it’s just as hard to be profitable in a niche that doesn’t generate a lot of interest.

Like I said, this won’t happen often, but it’s important to think about because it makes you calibrate your mindset. You shouldn’t focus on making profit so much that you skimp on choosing the right niche. Entering a huge dropshipping niche seems like it’s a good idea, but in reality, you can have a lot of trouble selling niche products when you have thousands and thousands of competitors.

### Is the Niche Sustainable?

This is another major question you need to ask about any niche you’re seriously considering for dropshipping. Whether you’re dropshipping on the side or full-time, you need to think about how sustainable a niche will be for you.

Even if you’ve already determined the niche is not just a fad that will blow over in a matter of months, you still need to think about the future. Considering the long term can mean the difference between success and failure. Plenty of niche products seem ideal for dropshipping, but when you think about where those niches will be a year from now, you start to realize that they might not be so promising.

Let’s go back to the example of phone cases. While the phone case niche is extremely saturated, there will always be a need for phone cases. People aren’t giving up their phones, and the amount of people with phones isn’t decreasing. Most importantly, people will always want to personalize and decorate their phones. Thus, it’s a sustainable niche.

Now let’s take another niche product with a very specific angle: eclipse-related products for the United States. When total solar eclipses happen, people go crazy with buying all kinds of gear related to the phenomenon. It seems like it’d be a no-brainer to set up a dropshipping retailer for this.

![unique niche products](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/special-niche.png)

However, total solar eclipses don’t occur in the U.S. very often. Because of that, a dropshipping store that sells eclipse products would only get business during eclipse years. Most years, it would get zero sales, which means these niche products are a poor choice for a long-term dropshipping business.

Finally, let’s consider a third niche: clothing with catchphrases. This is a tough trend to forecast because some catchphrases stick around while others don’t. (Think about the lasting “Keep Calm and ____” trend.)

While you could strike gold with the right catchphrase, this idea isn’t the best for a dropshipping store. The trend will eventually die out (even if it takes a couple of years), so if you’re looking to do dropshipping long term, you’d want to avoid those niche products.

When thinking about sustainability, ask yourself what the lifespan of the niche is. Do you see this niche being as popular a year from now? What about five years? What do experts think?

This can be a tough nut to crack, and sometimes there will be risk involved because it’s impossible to predict the future of any given niche. Just be sure you’re not pouring all your money into a fad that will be over a month or a year from now.

## Niche Evaluation in Action

Now you know all of the strategies for selecting which niche to choose, but maybe you’re a little confused about how it all comes together. So let’s put all of this into practice by looking at an example.

Let’s say you’re looking to set up your first dropshipping store, and you’ve searched the Internet for some niches that are ripe for new businesses.

You have a list of 4 niches:

-   Travel products
-   Custom T-shirts
-   Coding
-   Fidget spinners

To narrow this list down to just one final choice, you can ask the questions listed in the 2-step process above. Here’s how that might look.

### Question 1: Is this a product-based niche?

The first step is to filter out the niches that don’t have a large need for physical products. But even once you’ve done that, you want to gauge how well physical products could perform in the remaining niches.

Right off the bat, you can answer ‘no’ for coding. Coding has a few physical products associated with it, but for the most part it’s a digital-based niche. So you could remove that from your list.

The other three niches all have specific physical products associated with them, so they get a ‘yes’ for this question.

Now onto part 2 of this question. Exactly how big of a need does each niche have for products? You could argue that all three have fairly large needs, so for now you can keep considering all of them.

### Question 2: How popular is the niche?

Next, it’s time to [examine the popularity of each niche](https://obstacle.co/blog-niches/). Your answers here won’t necessarily eliminate any niches from your list. Instead, this step is meant to give you a sense of what you’re dealing with.

The problem with this question is that niche products fluctuate in popularity from time to time, so there are no hard-and-fast answers to this. It’s a question you have to answer for yourself. Conducting research on each niche is the best way to accurately analyze its current and future popularity.

But for the sake of argument, I’ll say that custom T-shirts and fidget spinners are very popular while travel products are moderately popular. Again, these terms are subjective, and I’m using them just for this example. In actual practice, you’ll want to have more specific data to compare.

That means you have the biggest chance selling travel-related niche products, but it also doesn’t eliminate the other two entirely. It’s simply a warning sign that those niches (custom T-shirts and fidget spinners) may be _too_ big to break into. Nothing is impossible; some niches are just easier than others for dropshipping.

### Question 3: Is this niche just the result of a passing fad?

This is an easy one. For fidget spinners, you can quickly answer ‘yes’, so that one has to go. Those niche products are definitely part of a fad that won’t carry on into the future.

On the other hand, custom T-shirts and travel products are not fads, so they can stay.

### Question 4: Can I actually add value to this niche?

This question will often decide whether you eliminate a niche or not. You have to put away your dreams of making it big and be brutally honest with yourself. Take any niche you’re seriously considering and ask yourself if you can  [add tons of value with a new online store](https://www.oberlo.com/ebooks/mindset/unique-selling-proposition). Will you be able to fill a need that other merchants aren’t filling? Will you be able to offer something new or different to prospective customers? Will you present or offer niche products that your competitors don’t sell?

This is a difficult question to answer, but in this example, the two niches left (custom T-shirts and travel products) are quite different in terms of market saturation. There’s no question that there are far more custom T-shirt stores than there are travel products stores.

It’s also difficult to add value to a niche when it’s so saturated, and you might find that’s the case with custom T-shirts. You can get any kind of custom T-shirt you can imagine, so you can’t really offer anything unique. However, it’s possible that with excellent design options, you could very well offer something your competitors can’t.

![t-shirt custom dropship](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/t-shirt.png)

This question might take you a while to answer, and that’s par for the course. You’ll also need to think critically and honestly about your ability to add value in niches that are more saturated. Overall, in this example, travel products would be the best choice.

### Question 5: Is the niche sustainable?

But wait! You’re not done yet. You have one step left: make sure the niche is sustainable.

There’s only one niche left: travel products. Travel-related niche products are certainly something people will always need, and people aren’t going to stop traveling anytime soon, so you can confidently say the niche is sustainable.

## Final Thoughts

Before I conclude this chapter, I want to say a few words on the process of niche selection.

I hope this example process has helped you see how to execute these strategies yourself. It won’t always be as easy as this to choose a niche, so be prepared to dig in and do some research. It can be hard to tell if certain niche products are unsustainable or too popular. Trust me when I say that even if you put in a ton of work on this step, it will all pay off in the future.

When you use this process, be thorough. Even if you narrow down your list to one niche early on, you still need to ask the rest of these questions. A good dropshipping niche will always pass this test. Of course, it could be that none of the niches you selected will work for you. That can be a hard pill to swallow because you’ll have to start all over again, but it’s much better than choosing the wrong niche.

Finally, bear in mind that you may need to revisit this step. The next chapter discusses how to select niche products, which is another complex issue in itself. You may find that your ideal niche has a super-crowded product landscape, or that it hasn’t been profitable for a long time.

In those kinds of situations, you might want to go through the niche selection process all over again. This can seem like grunt work, but you have to push through it until you find a profitable, sustainable niche with a good variety of products.

## You’ve Got a Dropshipping Niche! Now What?

Congratulations! You’ve completed one of the toughest steps in the journey!

Next, you have to choose the products you’re going to offer. Before you do so, I recommend taking some time to really familiarize yourself with your niche.

If you already know it inside and out, great. If not, take 7-14 days to study your niche. Take a look at the retailers in the niche, the products they sell, the reviews people give, and the ways people use the products. Get to know the niche from as many perspectives as possible. After that, you can start the process of choosing the best niche products for your store.
