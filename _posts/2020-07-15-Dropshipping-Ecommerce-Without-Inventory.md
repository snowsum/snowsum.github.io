## Introduction

![Introduction to dropshipping](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/drop1-1024x659.jpg)

For decades, starting a business was a costly and complicated affair. You had to raise sufficient funds all by yourself (or get investors), rent out a brick-and-mortar storefront, and get people in the door. Even today, running a traditional startup takes lots of money, time, and energy.

If you have dreams of [starting a business](https://www.shopify.com/content/5-questions-to-ask-yourself-before-starting-a-business?prev_msid=51732ef6-E0BF-4978-DD31-7A79E83E1382), it’s easy to quickly become discouraged. The upfront cost, time to launch, and legion of details make it seem as if your business will never become established, let alone successful.

Have you felt this way before? Have you gotten your hopes up only to have them crushed?

There is a growing trend among entrepreneurs to dispense with the traditional forms of launching a business. It’s called dropshipping, and it has made me rethink what I once thought was impossible.

Dropshipping places all the power into the hands of the entrepreneur. It provides a rapid and accessible way for any entrepreneur to generate an income and fulfill their dreams of establishing a wildly successful business.

If you feel like running your own business is out of the question, this guide is for you. I know what it’s like to be in your shoes, doubtful that you’ll ever make it, but I’m here to tell you that starting your own dropshipping business is completely realistic.

In my opinion, dropshipping is one of the best ways to start a business today. It’s incredibly easy to start, and you can begin with just a computer and a [little bit of money.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2vq3QmKWqE)

Dropshipping is also an extremely flexible career path, so you can do it as a side hustle or grow it into a full-time job. It’s completely possible to make a living from dropshipping alone, and there are countless entrepreneurs who have proven that.

And while dropshipping won’t make you a millionaire overnight, it can provide a stream of revenue that you can grow. With the right strategies, you might even be able to say goodbye to your day job and make dropshipping your main hustle.

[Stay-at-home parents](https://www.oberlo.com/ebooks/make-money-from-home), college students, office workers, and even retirees can all take advantage of dropshipping. It doesn’t matter how old you are, where you live, or what experience you have.

However, there’s a lot about dropshipping that is still shrouded in mystery. The good information is scattered all around the Internet, and it’s hard to tell what works and what doesn’t. If that’s not problematic enough, a good chunk of that information is outdated.

And sometimes, you might doubt the information you read. You don’t want half-baked theories – you want actionable advice from dropshipping veterans who know their stuff. That kind of advice isn’t always easy to get.

That’s why I’ve created this guide specifically for people like you. People who want to seriously pursue dropshipping but don’t know where to start.

Our goal is to make this a different kind of guide. I don’t approach dropshipping as a get-rich-quick scheme. Instead, I look at dropshipping as a way to strike out on your own while providing value to a particular niche.

I’ve taken everything you need to know about dropshipping and packed it all into this guide. This isn’t just a beginner’s guide, either. I’ll take you past the basics and address what you need to do after you get the ball rolling.

From choosing a niche to creating a digital marketing strategy, I’ve covered it all. You’ll find information on how to incorporate your company, set up a website, and research your competitors.

Finally, I’ll also address some of the problems that you may face. Not sure if that supplier is a scammer? I can help. Don’t know where to get a high quality [logo designed](https://www.oberlo.com/tools/logo-maker)? I’ll help with that too.

If you’ve ever wanted to know all the ins and outs of setting up a dropshipping business, this guide is for you. I’ll break everything down step by step and show you exactly what to do.
## What Is Dropshipping?

![what is dropshipping?](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/drop2-1.jpg)

Before we get any further, it’s important that you have an answer to the question ‘what is dropshipping?’

## What is Dropshipping?

**Dropshipping** is a type of retail fulfillment method. Instead of a store stocking products, it purchases the products from a third-party supplier. The products are then shipped directly to the consumer. Sound familiar? Maybe not, [but 33 percent of online stores](https://blog.3dcart.com/can-dropshipping-be-profitable-check-these-key-statistics) use dropshipping as a fulfillment model.

For the store, this is a mostly hands-off process. The merchant doesn’t have to order inventory or fulfill the orders in any way. Instead, the third-party supplier takes care of the product itself.

Dropshipping is great for entrepreneurs because it doesn’t demand as much as the traditional retail model. You don’t have to open a brick-and-mortar store, pay overhead, and stock products. Instead, you open an online storefront and buy wholesale from suppliers who already have products and warehouse space.

[The merchant is mainly responsible for gaining customers](https://www.shopify.com/guides/dropshipping/understanding-dropshipping?prev_msid=5176e1ff-48A2-467C-B115-D1C77587476D) and processing orders in dropshipping, meaning you’ll effectively be a middleman. Despite this, you’ll reap the lion’s share of the profit by marking up the items you sell. It’s a simple business model and one that can be very rewarding.

Millions of entrepreneurs flock to dropshipping because it requires less hassle and money to get started. That’s probably why you’re interested! And the best news of all? With dropshipping, you can build a business that’s sustainable in the long term right from your laptop.

Of course, there are many drawbacks and advantages, and it’s important that we look at them before you start your own dropshipping ecommerce business. Once you understand the pros and cons of dropshipping, however, learning how to do so effectively will be a breeze.

## Benefits of Dropshipping

**![Benefits of Dropshipping](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Benefits-of-Dropshipping-1024x1024.png)**

**Dropshipping is easy to start.** You don’t need to be a business guru to get started. In fact, you don’t even need any prior business experience! If you take some time to learn the basics, you can get started quickly and learn the rest as you go along.

Dropshipping is so easy because it requires very little from you. You [don’t need a warehouse to store products](https://www.oberlo.com/ecommerce-wiki/warehousing) or a team to help you out. You don’t have to worry about stocking or shipping either. You don’t even have to spend a certain amount of time every day on your store. It’s surprisingly hands-off, especially once you get going.

All of this means that you can start your business _today_. You can start getting everything up and running within a matter of hours.

You _will_ need some foundational knowledge and the right tools and resources, and that’s why we created this guide. By the time you’ve finished it, you’ll be equipped with the knowledge you need to jumpstart your own dropshipping business.

**Dropshipping is easy to grow.** As you scale up, your business model doesn’t have to change very much at all. You’ll have to put more work into sales and marketing as you grow, but your day-to-day will stay more or less the same.

One of the benefits of dropshipping is that the [costs don’t skyrocket when you scale](https://www.oberlo.com/blog/startup-costs-dropshipping). Because of this, it’s easy to keep growing at a pretty fast rate. You can do almost everything by yourself, too, unless you want to assemble a small team at some point.

**Dropshipping doesn’t demand a lot of capital.** Because starting a dropshipping business requires so little, you can get started with minimal funds. You can build an entire business right from your laptop, and you don’t need to make any high-level investments. Even as your business grows, your costs will be fairly low – especially when compared to traditional business expenses.

**Dropshipping is flexible.** This is one of its biggest benefits. You get to [be your own boss and set your own rules](https://www.oberlo.com/blog/what-is-entrepreneurship). It’s by far one of the most flexible careers that anyone can pursue.

You can work from home with little more than a laptop, and you can work at the times that are most convenient for you. This is ideal for entrepreneurs who want a business that works for them. You won’t have to bend over backwards to get things done. Instead, you set your own pace.

Dropshipping is also flexible in that it gives you a lot of room to make decisions that work for you. You can easily list new products whenever you want, and you can adjust your strategies on the fly. If you’re going on vacation, you can automate everything to run while you’re away. You get the idea – the possibilities are limitless.

**Dropshipping is easy to manage.** Since it doesn’t require you to make many commitments, you can manage everything with little hassle. Once you’ve [found suppliers and set everything up](https://www.oberlo.com/blog/dropshipping-suppliers), you’re mostly only responsible for your online storefront.

## **Disadvantages of Dropshipping**

**![Disadvantages of Dropshipping](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Disadvantages-of-Dropshipping-1024x1024.png)**

**Dropshipping has slim margins.** One of the disadvantages of dropshipping is that you should expect low margins initially. That’s not to say it can’t be profitable, but you should be aware that the product margin in some niches might be small.

This issue is especially problematic when you’re dropshipping in a [super-competitive niche](https://www.oberlo.com/blog/how-to-choose-a-niche). When you’re fighting for customers’ attention, you can’t afford to make the kind of profits you want to. If you choose the right niche, you’ll see larger margins. In niches with lower competition, you’ll have better margins, but at some point sales will start to plateau. That’s why dropshipping relies on a fair amount of sales to be profitable.

**Dropshipping can make order processing difficult.** Dropshipping seems straightforward: The customer orders, you process, and your supplier fulfills. And for the most part, it is simple.

However, if you’re sourcing products from multiple suppliers, you might run into some problems. Each of your suppliers might use a different shipping solution, which presents a problem for both you and your customers. Costs can get high, and shipping multiple products can be problematic.

Different suppliers will also have different structures in place for processing and billing. Since you have to manage the interaction with your suppliers, this can get tricky.

**Dropshipping doesn’t give you a lot of control.** One of the disadvantages of dropshipping is that you don’t have much control over certain aspects of the dropshipping process such as stocking products, order fulfillment, and shipping. You have to rely on your suppliers to do everything right and work seamlessly. This lack of control can be off-putting to some entrepreneurs, but it usually isn’t a problem.

This just means that when something goes wrong, it can be tricky to manage. While supplier problems can sometimes cause customer retention issues, you can mitigate them and keep customer churn to an absolute minimum with the right damage control.

**Dropshipping makes** [**customer service**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/customer-service.asp) **more challenging.** This is another problem that happens when orders go wrong or suppliers fail. Because you’re just the storefront and don’t have a lot of control, it can be difficult to sort out orders and handle customer support.

One of the most unfortunate disadvantages of dropshipping is that you have to take the blame when your customers complain. You could be doing everything right and still run into problems if your suppliers have issues.

## **Is Dropshipping for You?**

Because there are both pros and cons of dropshipping, it isn’t for everyone. This is especially true for people who are looking for a get-rich-quick scheme. Even if this isn’t your approach, you still might have one of these fears:

-   “I don’t know if I have enough time to start a business.”
-   “I don’t want to risk getting fired from my day job.”
-   “I don’t want to work so hard on dropshipping that I underperform at my 9-to-5.”

That said, nearly anyone can build a dropshipping business because you can put as much or as little into dropshipping as you want. Here are two common approaches.

## **Is Dropshipping Profitable?**

There are many ways to start and [grow a dropshipping business](https://www.oberlo.com/ebooks/dropshipping/growing-dropshipping-business). Our success stories talk about merchants who have started dropshipping businesses to make a few extra hundred bucks a month, while others have grown multiple six-figure stores. Whether you are looking to start dropshipping as an introduction into ecommerce or a business model to last forever, it is important to understand how dropshipping can be profitable to you.

### **Dropshipping as a Side Hustle**

![best side hustle jobs](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/best-side-hustle-jobs.jpg)

What is dropshipping’s main appeal? Because it’s flexible and it doesn’t demand much, it’s the ideal side job. Many entrepreneurs choose to do dropshipping [on the side](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/293954) while they have a main job that provides steady income. In other words, you don’t have to sacrifice your day job to pursue your dreams of becoming an entrepreneur.

The No. 1 worry here is that your employer will prevent you [from having a side hustle](https://www.oberlo.com/blog/side-hustle), but believe it or not, many companies are fine with it. You’ll want to make sure you’re in the clear by asking about your company’s policy on side businesses and review any non-compete agreements you’ve signed. You also definitely want to ensure there’s no conflict of interest. But if everything checks out, then you’re good to go.

You don’t need to dedicate too much time and energy to dropshipping, meaning you’ll likely be able to take it on without a hitch. Worried that your side hustle will make you underperform? You don’t have to be! You can spend only a couple hours on your business every day and still succeed.

However, it’s important to know your limits. If you regularly work overtime at your day job and struggle to find time for important daily responsibilities, you might not be able to give a dropshipping business the attention it needs. Even though dropshipping doesn’t require a lot, you do need to carve out time in your day for it.

In most cases, it just takes a little bit of [time management and scheduling](https://www.oberlo.com/blog/time-tracker-apps). Plenty of dropshipping retailers manage their main and side jobs easily. You don’t need to sleep three hours a night or skip meals to make it work. You’ll need to figure out a schedule that works for you and stick to it religiously.

### **Dropshipping as a Full-Time Ecommerce Business**

![eCommerce Business](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ecommerce-business-1024x404.png)

One of the benefits of dropshipping is the flexibility. You can make your business as big or as small as you want it to be. Many dropshippers choose to do it on the side, but it’s also a viable career path. If you want to be a full-time dropshipping retailer, you can be!

It’s easy to scale up your business with dropshipping, meaning you can grow your business pretty quickly while keeping costs down. Once you’ve reached customers and gotten enough sales, you can move from dropshipping part-time to full-time. Best of all, you can make this happen at whatever pace you want.

Obviously, this is going to take more work, but the payoff is well worth it. Once you figure out how to dropship effectively, you won’t have to worry about unsteady revenue. A well-established dropshipping ecommerce business operates like clockwork, and it can even feel like you’re generating passive income.

And since it doesn’t take up a lot of time, you could even take on a side hustle while still being a full-time dropshipping retailer! The sky’s the limit.

Maybe you’re rolling your eyes right now at the thought of becoming a full-time dropshipper, but there are thousands of success stories from entrepreneurs who started out right where you are today. It doesn’t take a degree in business or millions in capital to make a living from it.

## **The Dropshipping Process**

Now that we’ve covered what dropshipping _is_, let’s discuss exactly how it _works_. Here’s a step-by-step overview of the entire dropshipping process as well as a look at what the customer experiences (and why it matters).

![the dropshipping process](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/the-dropshipping-process.png)

## **Understanding the Supply Chain**

In this guide, you’ll see the term “[supply chain”](https://www.oberlo.com/ecommerce-wiki/supply) a lot. It sounds like fancy industry lingo, but it simply refers to how a product moves from supplier to customer. We’ll use this to discuss the dropshipping process.

## ![the supply chain process](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/supply-chain.png)

[Image source](https://www.slideshare.net/hari3hhh/e-scm-45891860)

You, the retailer, are just one piece of the puzzle. A successful dropshipping operation relies on multiple parties all working together in sync. The supply chain is exactly that: the coordination of the manufacturer, supplier, and retailer.

The supply chain can be broken down into three basic steps:

**1. The manufacturer creates the products and sells them in bulk to suppliers and wholesalers.**

Let’s say Manufacturer A makes water bottles. After the bottles roll off the production line, they’re sold in bulk to suppliers and wholesalers, who turn around and resell the bottles to retailers.

**2. Suppliers and wholesalers sell the products to retailers.**

A retailer like yourself searches out a supplier for a specific type of product. The retailer and supplier then enter into an agreement to work together.

[![](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image6.png)Image source](https://www.pexels.com/photo/blur-bottle-brand-branding-593099/)

A small note here: While you can buy directly from product manufacturers, it’s often much easier to purchase from suppliers instead. Most manufacturers have minimum purchase requirements that can be rather high, and you’d also have to store, stock, and ship the products.

So, it might seem simpler to buy straight from the manufacturer, but you’ll benefit most from buying from suppliers (and dealing with the slight markup).

Suppliers are also convenient because many of them specialize in a certain niche, so you can easily find the kind of products you need. This also means you can get started selling super quickly.

**3. Retailers sell the products to consumers.**

Suppliers and wholesalers do not sell directly to the public; that’s the retailer’s job. The retailer is the final step between the product and the consumer.

Retailers provide online storefronts from which consumers purchase products. After the wholesaler marks up the product, the retailer marks it up yet again to arrive at the final price. By “markup,” we’re referring to [setting a price](https://help.oberlo.com/product-pricing/how-to-set-prices-for-dropshipped-products?prev_msid=5176e1ff-48A2-467C-B115-D1C77587476D) that covers the cost price of the item and brings you a profit.

That’s it! That’s the entire supply chain from start to finish. It’s a straightforward but crucial concept in business.

You might have noticed that no one specific party was referred to as a dropshipper. That’s because “dropshipper” is not a specific role. Dropshipping is simply the action of shipping products for someone else. Manufacturers, suppliers, and merchants can all technically be dropshippers.

Later in this guide, we’ll cover how to start a _dropshipping retail_ business. In other words, you’ll learn how to become the merchant that purchases products from wholesalers to sell to the public. This could mean you sell via eBay or your own website with an online storefront.

Now that you know what the supply chain looks like, consider what it’s like for the customer.

## **What About Customer Experiences?**

You’ve bought products online hundreds of times before, but you’ve probably never thought about the experience. It’s second nature for consumers. As a customer, you don’t _need_ to think about it, but as a retailer, you absolutely should.

![](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image10-1.png)

[Image source](http://www.ephlux.com/the-new-rule-dont-map-all-your-customers-in-one-journey)

Retailers can learn a lot by thinking about the ideal customer experience of ordering from a retailer. This may seem obvious, but if there are any snags in the customer experience, it could spell trouble for you as a retailer. It’s important to [know what your buyers expect](https://www.oberlo.com/ebooks/get-sales-dropshipping/customer-experience).

Let’s pretend you have a business called Fancy Water Bottles, a site called FancyWaterBottles.com, and a wholesaler called Water Bottles Worldwide. Here’s what the ordering process would look like from the customer’s perspective:

1.  Customer A places an order for a water bottle on FancyWaterBottles.com and immediately receives an email confirmation of the purchase.
2.  After a few hours and up to a couple of days, Customer A receives a notification that their order has shipped. The notification includes tracking information, so Customer A knows exactly where their package is while en route.
3.  Customer A receives the water bottle.

It’s the same process you’ve gone through each time you’ve purchased anything online. This seems basic, but there are two important aspects of this experience.

First, it’s simple. All the customer has to do is order the product and pay for it. Everything else, like an order confirmation email and tracking information, is handed to them on a silver platter.

And that brings us to our second point: convenience. The buying experience is extremely convenient in every way. An online purchase takes just minutes to make, and customers can browse any retailer’s site at their leisure. And if all goes well, the customer won’t even have to interact with anyone. It takes the minimum amount of effort to achieve the desired result of getting a product.

This experience is a lot like buying a water bottle at a big box store and using the self-checkout. It’s a no-fuss process that doesn’t present any problems. This is a big reason why people buy online in the first place, so your storefront has to give your customers that same level of convenience.

Last but not least, the customer should never notice that any other parties besides the retailer are involved. Think about it. When you buy something online, you think, “I bought a water bottle from Fancy Water Bottles.” You don’t consider where the retailer got the product or who might be shipping your order.

To make the process seamless, the customer shouldn’t be aware of all the stops their product makes. The package they receive will have your retail name on it, so as far as the customer is concerned, you fulfilled and shipped the order.

This is how the dropshipping process should ideally look from the customer’s point of view. Now, let’s break down what happens on the other end.

## **What Happens Behind the Scenes**

That’s what the customer sees, but what is dropshipping like behind the scenes?. Here’s an overview of the process:

1.  Customer A places an order for a water bottle on FancyWaterBottles.com and receives an email confirmation of the process. Let’s say the total came to $14.95.  
    Fancy Water Bottles receives the same email confirmation as well as Customer A’s payment. This is usually  [made possible by automated software](https://www.oberlo.com/blog/marketing-automation)  that sends out the confirmation to both buyer and seller.
2.  Fancy Water Bottles sends the order to Water Bottles Worldwide. Typically, a sales representative from Water Bottles Worldwide will receive and process the order. The retailer will then be charged for the purchase.  
    For this example, let’s say Water Bottles Worldwide charges $12.95 for each water bottle. The retailer will pay that amount, and the difference is the profit the retailer will make. In this case, the retailer will net a profit of $2.00.
3.  Water Bottles Worldwide packs up the order.  
    Although the wholesaler ships the product, the package will be addressed from Fancy Water Bottles, and the Fancy Water Bottles name will appear on the invoice and packing slip. (This is so the customer will recognize the retailer’s name on the package.) The wholesaler then sends an invoice and tracking information to the retailer.
4.  The retailer sends along the shipping information to the customer. This finalizes the retailer’s role in the order process.
5.  The customer receives the package and enjoys the water bottle.

That’s the supply chain in action. You can see how the retailer, wholesaler, and manufacturer all have to work together flawlessly. When done right, it’s a smooth process that results in minimal work for everyone involved.

One point that needs to be stressed is that you, the retailer, are responsible only for two steps: sending orders to the supplier and shipment information to the consumer. Sometimes, you’ll have to be responsible for other things like customer support, but if everything goes smoothly, those two steps are the only ones you have to complete.

## Getting Started With Dropshipping

![](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image3-1.png)

All of this sounds like a complicated puzzle, but once you learn how to dropship, it’s a smooth process for everyone involved. You, the dropshipping merchant, can do everything remotely and never even touch a single product!

Remember that you don’t need any business experience to open a dropshipping storefront. It certainly helps, but it’s not necessary. Many budding entrepreneurs don’t ever chase their dreams because they believe they need an MBA or years’ worth of experience. This is not the case. One of the benefits of dropshipping is that you can learn how to dropship as you go.

Better yet, there are numerous resources that make dropshipping easier than ever before. For example, this useful video provides some great advice on getting started. You can have absolutely zero business experience and still easily make a profit. You’ll need to learn the ropes along the way, and it will be challenging at times, but it’s more than worth it.

Now that you understand what dropshipping is, read on to find out what you need to get started!
## What You Need To Start Your Dropshipping Business

![dropshipping business](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/drop3.jpg)

If you’ve gotten this far, you probably want to get started with setting up your own dropshipping business. You’ve seen how easy it can be, and you’re ready for the road ahead. So in this chapter, I’ll tell you what you need to start dropshipping.

Since a dropshipping retail business takes place completely online, you won’t have to spend a whole lot, but you will need to plan well and think ahead.

There are some misconceptions about what one needs to start a successful dropshipping business. Many people will tell you to just find a wholesaler, get a site up, and start selling. But that’s a recipe for disaster. Businesses who take this approach often crash and burn in no time at all.

Simply put, there are right and wrong ways to approach your dropshipping business. If you’re trying to make money fast, your business will suffer. That’s why I advocate a different perspective: the idea that **dropshipping retailers should meet the needs of customers in a specific niche.**

Naturally, you’ll need certain tools and resources to get started, but you’ll also need to learn new concepts and develop the right mindset. You’ll need to put tons of thought into how you want to set up your business and what goals you want to achieve.

With that in mind, let’s go over the must-haves for a successful dropshipping business. I’ll delve into these in devoted chapters, but right now let’s take a look at the big picture.

## Value

Before you go looking for suppliers (and before you even choose a niche), you need to focus on value. This is something I’m going to bring up regularly throughout this guide because it’s such a crucial principle.

![value proposition](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/value-proposition--625x470.png)

[Source](https://masterful-marketing.com/value-proposition/)

Frankly, many dropshipping businesses don’t care about value. Dropshipping has gained a somewhat bad reputation because many dropshipping retailers are just trying to outsell their competitors by offering [cheaply made products.](https://www.oberlo.com/blog/avoid-counterfeit-goods-aliexpress) To make matters worse, dropshippers will sometimes resort to shady tactics to sell and one-up the competition. All of this has led people to believe that it’s a scammy practice, but that couldn’t be further from the truth.

A dropshipping business is just like any other business, so it makes sense that you should approach dropshipping the way you’d approach another kind of business. Sadly, many individuals overlook this. Ultimately,  [people quit dropshipping](https://www.oberlo.com/videos/why-people-quit-dropshipping)  because they don’t take the time to build a sturdy foundation.

Thinking about value will help you start up a successful dropshipping business. It’ll help you stand out from your competitors, and more importantly, you’ll be focusing on the single most important aspect of any business, dropshipping or otherwise.

The best way to focus on value is to build it into your dropshipping business from the start. Everything you do should add value to your audience in some way.

If value is your number one priority, you’ll be much more likely to get consumers’ attention, and your business will last much longer than other dropshippers who just want to make a quick buck.

Wondering _how_ you can make value your priority? Well, there are some important questions you need to ask yourself before doing anything else:

-   Who are you trying to help? What type of people do you want to reach, and what do they want?
-   What niche(s) could you add value to?
-   What kinds of products do customers in my niche want?
-   How can I put my customers first?

In short, the best way to provide value is to listen to your potential customers, find out what they want, and then give it to them. Your job is to give customers the best possible experience.

Keeping value a priority has tangible benefits for your dropshipping business. Having this attitude will help you:

-   Acquire and retain customers
-   Grow a loyal customer base
-   Stand out from your competitors
-   Make your business unique and trustworthy

Throughout this guide, you’ll notice a consistent theme of adding value. It’s important that you don’t lose sight of this goal as you go on. It’s easy to get caught up in the rush of starting a business, but you have to remember to always keep value first.

## The Right Niche

Have you ever wondered why so many dropshipping businesses are unsuccessful?

Sometimes it can seem like retailers are dropping like flies, and it can be discouraging at first. But there are common mistakes that tons of dropshippers make.

One of the biggest  [dropshipping failures](https://www.oberlo.com/videos/six-figure-dropshippers-share-their-biggest-dropshipping-failures)  is choosing the wrong niche. That’s right – one of the most common reason dropshipping retailers fail is because they chose the wrong niche.

To understand why this happens, let’s consider some common dropshipping niches:

-   Phone accessories (especially cases)
-   Clothing
-   Beauty/cosmetics products
-   Books
-   Entertainment (e.g., movies, music, etc.)

You’ve probably seen a thousand different dropshipping businesses that offer at least one of these types of items.

The problem? These niches are all _extremely_ high competition.

Think about dropshipping retailers that sell phone cases. If you want to buy phone cases online, you can choose from thousands and thousands of businesses. From Etsy to eBay and everywhere in between, there are too many phone case stores to count.

If you want to sell phone cases, you’ll have to go up against dropshipping stores who have been doing this for years. You’ll have to cut through the noise, advertise like crazy, and hope people find you (and choose to buy from you).

More importantly, it’s hard to add real value to a niche like that. When you dropship, you’re often choosing from the same products your competitors buy. That means you have to take an entirely different approach to adding value.

The dropshipping niche you choose is a huge determining factor for value. If you choose a less popular niche, there’s a good possibility you can step in and fill a need in that niche. But if you choose a niche that’s super crowded, it’s going to be almost impossible to differentiate yourself from your competitors (who have been around longer and are more popular).

Of course, choosing the right niche is a crucial decision for any business, but many dropshipping businesses seem to completely overlook it. Most dropshippers assume that they can just choose a hot trend and jump on the bandwagon.

When you’re choosing a niche, there’s a lot to consider. That’s why I’ve dedicated  [Chapter 4](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/ebooks/dropshipping/finding-niche-products?prev_msid=5177c435-23EC-4B8A-1999-B332032A284F)  to helping you settle on a dropshipping niche.

## The Right Products

Once you’ve settled on a niche, it’s time to take the next step and think about the kinds of products your store will offer.

It’s not as simple as choosing dropshipping products that seem popular. You need to be picky about your products. In order to establish a successful dropshipping business, you need to select your products carefully and base your choices on what your audience wants and needs.

![dropshipping product selection](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/product-selection-975x620.png)

Again, you have to think about value. While looking at [bestselling products](https://www.oberlo.com/blog/unique-dropshipping-products-sell-2018) is a good place to start, it’s not the be-all, end-all of product selection. You have to make sure the products you offer have significant value to your customer base. Many popular dropshipping products are only popular for a while. If you choose products that have lasting value, you’ll be able to offer products that can stand the test of time.

At the same time, you want to analyze product trends and use them to your advantage. If certain products have boomed over the last few months, they’ll probably sell very well. Later in this guide, I’ll show you how to analyze trends and figure out which products will be best for you.

Once you start dropshipping products, you might decide to change the items you offer according to your audience’s needs. Still, aim to start off strong and establish a line of products that will do well for you.

Finally, bear in mind that  [product selection](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/ebooks/make-money-from-home/products-to-sell-from-home?prev_msid=5177c435-23EC-4B8A-1999-B332032A284F)  is an ongoing process. You need to stay up-to-date with trends in your niche and change up your storefront accordingly. That’s why I’m sharing specific strategies for product research. Your goal is to use these strategies on a regular basis to optimize your store for sales and overall performance.

## An Incorporated Business

Most suppliers and wholesalers require any business they work with to be legally incorporated. In fact, if you’re not incorporated, most wholesalers won’t show you their pricing or other details. That’s how important it is.

Remember, a dropshipping business is still a business. It should follow many of the same rules as a traditional business. Dropshipping may take place online, but it still needs to be conducted according to the law.

If you don’t follow these important rules, you’ll run into problems. The bottom line: it’s best to be incorporated before you even reach out to suppliers.

![benefits of incorporating](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/incorporation-benefits.png)

[Image source](https://legallogik.com/incorporation-top-advantages/)

I’ll cover this in more detail in Chapter 6, but for now, just remember that at some point, you’re going to have to take the time to make sure your business is legal and good to go.

## Supplier(s)

As you might have guessed, getting suppliers and wholesalers on board is an absolute necessity. Since you’ll get your [products directly from suppliers](https://www.oberlo.com/blog/dropshipping-suppliers), you obviously want to work with companies that have a great track record and solid communication.

You’ll need to put some serious time and consideration into this part of the process. You don’t want to choose the first wholesaler you see, and you also don’t want to blindly go with the most popular suppliers you can find with a Google search.

You’ll have to weigh your options, compare prices, and make sure you have access to the dropshipping products you need. There are also certain protocols you’ll need to follow when contacting wholesalers and making arrangements with them.

Chapter 9 is entirely devoted to helping you find suppliers, so if this seems intimidating, don’t worry. I’ll be addressing everything you need to know about choosing the right suppliers for your business.

## A Game Plan

There’s one last major ingredient you need: a game plan. By ‘game plan’, I mean a vision for your business and actionable steps to make that vision happen.

You don’t need to plan out every little thing you’re going to do, but you should have an idea of how you’re going to approach your new business. You want to get a sense of the big picture and then figure out the smaller details. It never hurts to be too thorough.

Here are some areas to consider:

-   Getting sales
-   Taking a certain angle in your niche
-   Digital marketing strategies
-   Optimizing your online store

This is also a good time to ask the tough questions so you can prepare yourself for them. For example, what if you’re getting nowhere after 6 months? 1 year? It’s not fun to think about these kinds of things, but doing so might save you from utter failure.

Another question you might want to ask yourself is, “Ideally, where do I want my business to go over the next X years?” This is a more general  [dropshipping FAQ](https://www.oberlo.com/podcast/dropshipping-questions-answers)  that can help guide your vision.

If you know exactly what you want, you can take steps toward making it happen. The more specific you get, the better. It might help you to draft up a business plan or even a flowchart that traces the ideal trajectory of your business.

## Getting Started

So far, you haven’t been able to actually do anything. I know it’s not fun, but it’s how every legendary business started out.

But now, that’s all going to change. You’ll soon be able to put the knowledge and strategies you’ve developed to work.

By now, you should know:

-   The niches you’re interested in
-   The types of products you want to offer
-   Your plan for your store’s future

Now you can start setting up your business in earnest. First, I’ll dive into selecting a niche for your store.
## Choosing Your Niche

![niche products](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/notebook-man-working-people-woman-notepad-764658-pxhere.com_.jpg)

So you’ve decided to start a dropshipping retail business, and you’re wondering what to do first. The first big decision you have to make is [which niche products to offer](https://www.oberlo.com/blog/dropshipping-niches). The best way to ensure that your business is successful is to think carefully about which niche is the best dropshipping niche for you.

Settling on a niche is a bit more complicated than it seems. For dropshipping, you want to pick a niche that’s profitable and that doesn’t have insane levels of competition. That’s the basic formula. The right research will help you do this, but it will take some time.

If you already have a niche you’re eyeballing, you need to analyze that niche from a retailer’s perspective and consider how successful you’d actually be in that niche. On the other hand, if you have no niche in mind, that’s fine too. I’ll be covering every step from researching the top dropshipping niches to narrowing down your options.

I know it’s tempting to find the hottest new niche and spend an afternoon setting up a store. In fact, that’s what a large number of dropshippers do. They see which niche products are exploding and blindly hop on the bandwagon.

However, this is not a good method. You might achieve runaway success for a while, but after that ends, you’ll probably watch your business fall apart. This happens to almost every entrepreneur who capitalizes on the latest craze. A business model like that simply isn’t meant to last, and my goal is to help you create a sustainable dropshipping retail career.

**If you want to turn dropshipping into a steadily flowing stream of income, you’ll need to choose your niche carefully.** In fact, niche selection is one of the most important business decisions you’ll ever make. It sets the stage for everything else to follow.

Think about it. The niche you choose will influence:

-   What products you offer
-   How much you sell
-   Which suppliers you work with
-   What marketing strategies you use
-   How successful your business will ultimately be

It’s a big decision, and it’s not one to be taken lightly. Too often, dropshippers realize the niche they chose isn’t working out, and they have to go back square one. That can be a colossal waste of time, money, and other important resources, especially if you’ve been at it for a while.

The more thought you put into selecting a niche, the sturdier your business will be. You won’t doubt yourself a few months down the road. And that’s what this chapter is all about: helping you find the best dropshipping niche for your business.

I find that a lot of success with dropshipping comes from asking the right questions. So without further ado, let’s look at the most important questions you need to ask yourself when selecting a niche.

## How to Evaluate Dropshipping Niche Ideas

Choosing a niche can be confusing. There are millions of niches, so it’s tricky to know which ones are viable. To make matters worse, many of those niches have established businesses you’d be competing directly against. It’s the million dollar question: how do you break into a profitable niche as a newbie?

When you’re thinking about this, it may seem like every niche is saturated, but that’s not true. There are niches that still have a genuine need for product purchasing options. Some niches haven’t been tapped into heavily, while other niches have product-based needs that your store could help with.

However, it can be difficult to know where to just _start_ looking for optimal dropshipping niche ideas. Where do you look? _How_ do you look? What criteria should you use for finding good niches? To the beginner, these are daunting questions.

There’s a reason it’s so intimidating: niche evaluation is really a specialized field of its own. You could spend months choosing the best niche, but that’s not exactly practical for dropshipping. Luckily, there are tactics you can use to choose a great niche in a matter of weeks (or even days, though you shouldn’t rush it).

Basically, you have to determine if a niche is suitable based on the following:

-   The level of competition
-   The demand for physical niche products
-   The long term forecast of niche popularity

The best dropshipping niche would have low to medium competition and high demand. It would also stay popular indefinitely. Of course, niches like this don’t exist, so you have to figure out how to balance these criteria. The right balance for you might not be right for another entrepreneur, so you have to think critically about which elements are most important to you.

Here’s a simple two-step process you can use to start your search for a niche. It revolves around the idea that some niches are better for physical products than others. Once you’ve found those niches, you can ask other questions to help you narrow it down further.

## Step 1: Search for trending or low-Competition niches.

Begin by doing a simple Google search for ‘trending niches’ or ‘low-competition niches’. You’ll have to narrow your search a lot, but this is a basic start. You’re just taking baby steps for now and getting a very big picture sense of the various dropshipping niche ideas out there.

![finding niche products](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/niche-products.png)

Typically when you search for trending niches, you’ll find lists of niche products that are currently popular or predicted to become popular in the coming months. These have a lot of potential, but they may also get crowded.

Low-competition niches, by definition, won’t be too crowded, but this could limit how much you can earn. Niches with super-low levels of competition will usually have smaller audiences, and that translates into a smaller customer base for your business.

In addition, some niches won’t be right for dropshipping, so you’ll want to make sure you’re looking at product-based niches. (For example, explainer videos have surged in popularity, but an explainer video is not a physical product, so dropshipping is out of the question.)

When you’re looking at niches, you want to make sure they meet a few important criteria. You could do this later, but I feel it’s best to filter your results early on. Here are some questions to ask:

### Is This a Product-Based Niche?

First, it’s essential to make sure the niche you’re considering has a decent amount of physical products associated with it. Some niches, like explainer videos, have no product-based needs at all. Other niches do have product-based needs but not many. For example, niches that mostly deal with digital products, like cryptocurrency, aren’t all that practical for dropshipping because of the low amount of physical products available.

As you do more research, you’ll see that certain niches are inherently more plentiful with products than others. For example, clothing is better than time management for dropshipping because it offers more product variety.

The more niche products you can offer, the better. You don’t want to sell everything under the sun, but you do want to have a good amount of variety. That’s why a niche that has lots of products is great for dropshipping. It gives you a ton of room for growth and expansion.

This can be tough because with a high amount of product variety, there’s often a high level of competition. However, if you look outside of the most popular niches, you should be able to find some niches that aren’t too competitive yet still have a good amount of product variety.

Last but not least, make sure the products are easily accessible for both you and your customers. For example, custom made items are generally more difficult to dropship, and they won’t give you the best profit margins. You also want to consider the fact that the more obscure niche products won’t have a broad appeal. As a general rule, a product that appeals to a wide group of people within the niche is a good product to dropship.

### How Popular Is This Niche?

Ideally, you’re after a niche that’s not _too_ popular. You want to choose a niche that has sufficient interest and product demand to sustain a retail business. Often, you will have to compromise, and it’s a matter of knowing _how_ to compromise.

When conducting niche research, if you can tell right away that a niche is incredibly popular, be warned that it may be difficult to break into. As a new dropshipper, you’ll face the challenge of getting your brand seen, and it’s much easier in a lower competition niche (even though bigger niches may be tempting and seem easy).

![low competition niche](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/low-comp-niche.png)

[Image source](https://www.nichepursuits.com/low-competition-keywords-rank-google/)

The niche evaluation steps in this chapter will help you find a good niche that’s not too empty or too crowded. And in Chapter 5, when you research products, you’ll get an even more detailed idea of how popular your chosen niche is.

### Is This Niche Just the Result of a Passing Fad?

Every year, there are several handfuls of trends that come and go in a matter of months (sometimes weeks). Businesses pop up left and right to capitalize on these trends, but when the trends die, so do the businesses.

At the same time, a new trend could become the next big niche. Lately, niche products like drones, fidget spinners, and virtual reality gear have become hugely popular in a matter of months, and the dropshippers in these niches have scored big. However, there’s always a risk involved with going with the coolest new niche, so it is usually safer to choose a niche that’s been around for a while.

If you find a niche that’s relatively new, it might not be a good idea to pursue it, but you have to evaluate this on a case-by-case basis. As a rule of thumb, you should give preference to niches with established (or at least devoted) communities.

### Am I Too Passionate About This Niche?

I know this seems like a weird question because usually passion is a good thing. But in this case, too much passion can actually be detrimental to your dropshipping career.

Let’s say you have a lifelong love of lava lamps. That passion is great, but it won’t necessarily translate into sales. You can’t build a dropshipping career on lava lamps because they’re very niche and not big sellers. You can have all the passion in the world for lava lamps, but you can’t magically turn them into a sustainable career.

In addition, passion can often blind you to the harsh truths that come with operating a business. Maybe certain niche products aren’t selling well but you want to keep it around anyway because you like it and believe it will do well. So while it seems like having lots of passion is good, it’s usually ideal to have a fair amount of detachment from the niche products you choose.

That’s not to say you can’t pick your favorite niche for dropshipping. If you’re able to objectively evaluate your niche and if it looks like a good choice, go for it. Getting an outside view helps a lot with this decision.

You need to step back from what you think of a niche and look at it through an entrepreneurial lens. You’re going to have to make business decisions based on facts and figures, and you need to be able to do that easily without being too emotionally or personally invested.

### Can I Actually Add Value to This Niche?

This is another question few dropshippers ask. Most people think that opening up a store _is_ a form of adding value, but that’s not always true.

If you’re opening a store that’s basically a carbon copy of an existing store, you’re not doing anything new or unique. You have very little to differentiate yourself from your competitors.

![adding value](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/value.png)

But the most problematic thing is that some entrepreneurs who start dropshipping businesses like this don’t _want_ to provide value. These are the get-rich-quick schemers who see dropshipping as a means to an end. Customers can see right through this, and it’s also a poor attitude to have in general.

It’s easy to tell if a business is earnestly trying to provide value or just trying to make a quick buck. People are more likely to support businesses that give them value. By putting your customers first and emphasizing value, you’ll be creating the best conditions for your business to grow.

If you don’t focus on value, you’ll have a harder time selling.

That’s why you need to be honest with yourself here. Can you _really_ add value to the niche you’re considering? Can you offer something different to customers who have a bunch of retailers to choose from?

One of the best ways to evaluate this is by looking at retailers who are already in the niche, and that’s what the second step is all about. However, this is a question you should start thinking about now.

If you feel like you can’t take an interesting angle or do something differently, reconsider the niche (as painful as that may be). Rather revise your niche than choose one that won’t work for you.

## Step 2: Search for existing retailers.

Next, spend some time researching the retailers who are already established in the niche. For now, simple Google searches will suffice. Use various combinations and product keywords to see who’s selling what, and pay attention to who the big players are (i.e., the retailers you see over and over again).

This step really deserves an analytical approach if you want to get the most out of it. I recommend keeping a list of the retailers you find and making sure to record details like their name, website, and social handles. (A spreadsheet is great for this.)

Don’t just look at the most popular stores – search high and low, and look at everything that’s out there. There may be smaller retailers who are becoming popular and doing something unique, and analyzing these stores is just as important as analyzing the big names in your niche.

And don’t be afraid to take extensive notes on what you see. Often it’s the little things that matter, and scrutinizing details can help you understand why some retailers’ strategies are so successful. Once you understand what they’re doing, you can break it down and use the knowledge for yourself.

Once you’ve gotten a list of 5-10 retailers, take this opportunity to also look at each store’s online presence. You don’t need to do extensive research at this point. Just take a look at each retailer’s site and social media accounts to get a rough idea of their strategies. See what kinds of content they post, how they engage customers, and when they mention their products.

If you can’t find many retailers, that could be a good or a bad sign. Low competition is great, but you still need to have a sizeable audience to buy your niche products. This means that if you barely find any retailers, you’ll need to look at pages and online communities dedicated to the niche. Lots of activity is good, but low activity means this niche is probably a bad choice. It could also mean that this niche doesn’t have a huge need for physical products.

This step doesn’t need to determine the niche you choose, but it should give you an idea of what you’re dealing with. It will clue you into how popular the niche is and how much value you could give customers. Again, don’t be afraid to spend a lot of time on this step.

When you’re finished, you should have a list of niches that are practical for dropshipping, along with the details of retailers who are already in those niches.

### Is It Better to Choose a Super Saturated or Super Unsaturated Niche?

[The perfect niche](https://www.oberlo.com/blog/what-should-you-sell-online) would have low competition but a large audience. In the real world, that rarely happens. The typical niche is moderately saturated, with a reasonable number of retailers and an audience that’s not too big or too small.

But what if you’re stuck between choosing a super-saturated or a super-unsaturated niche? That’s a tough decision. It’s important to note that you probably won’t have to choose between these two extremely different options. Most of the time, you’ll find niches that aren’t completely saturated or unsaturated.

If those _are_ your only choices, you might want to go back to the drawing board and consider other dropshipping niche ideas. It’s hard to be profitable in a niche that has a huge amount of competition, but it’s just as hard to be profitable in a niche that doesn’t generate a lot of interest.

Like I said, this won’t happen often, but it’s important to think about because it makes you calibrate your mindset. You shouldn’t focus on making profit so much that you skimp on choosing the right niche. Entering a huge dropshipping niche seems like it’s a good idea, but in reality, you can have a lot of trouble selling niche products when you have thousands and thousands of competitors.

### Is the Niche Sustainable?

This is another major question you need to ask about any niche you’re seriously considering for dropshipping. Whether you’re dropshipping on the side or full-time, you need to think about how sustainable a niche will be for you.

Even if you’ve already determined the niche is not just a fad that will blow over in a matter of months, you still need to think about the future. Considering the long term can mean the difference between success and failure. Plenty of niche products seem ideal for dropshipping, but when you think about where those niches will be a year from now, you start to realize that they might not be so promising.

Let’s go back to the example of phone cases. While the phone case niche is extremely saturated, there will always be a need for phone cases. People aren’t giving up their phones, and the amount of people with phones isn’t decreasing. Most importantly, people will always want to personalize and decorate their phones. Thus, it’s a sustainable niche.

Now let’s take another niche product with a very specific angle: eclipse-related products for the United States. When total solar eclipses happen, people go crazy with buying all kinds of gear related to the phenomenon. It seems like it’d be a no-brainer to set up a dropshipping retailer for this.

![unique niche products](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/special-niche.png)

However, total solar eclipses don’t occur in the U.S. very often. Because of that, a dropshipping store that sells eclipse products would only get business during eclipse years. Most years, it would get zero sales, which means these niche products are a poor choice for a long-term dropshipping business.

Finally, let’s consider a third niche: clothing with catchphrases. This is a tough trend to forecast because some catchphrases stick around while others don’t. (Think about the lasting “Keep Calm and ____” trend.)

While you could strike gold with the right catchphrase, this idea isn’t the best for a dropshipping store. The trend will eventually die out (even if it takes a couple of years), so if you’re looking to do dropshipping long term, you’d want to avoid those niche products.

When thinking about sustainability, ask yourself what the lifespan of the niche is. Do you see this niche being as popular a year from now? What about five years? What do experts think?

This can be a tough nut to crack, and sometimes there will be risk involved because it’s impossible to predict the future of any given niche. Just be sure you’re not pouring all your money into a fad that will be over a month or a year from now.

## Niche Evaluation in Action

Now you know all of the strategies for selecting which niche to choose, but maybe you’re a little confused about how it all comes together. So let’s put all of this into practice by looking at an example.

Let’s say you’re looking to set up your first dropshipping store, and you’ve searched the Internet for some niches that are ripe for new businesses.

You have a list of 4 niches:

-   Travel products
-   Custom T-shirts
-   Coding
-   Fidget spinners

To narrow this list down to just one final choice, you can ask the questions listed in the 2-step process above. Here’s how that might look.

### Question 1: Is this a product-based niche?

The first step is to filter out the niches that don’t have a large need for physical products. But even once you’ve done that, you want to gauge how well physical products could perform in the remaining niches.

Right off the bat, you can answer ‘no’ for coding. Coding has a few physical products associated with it, but for the most part it’s a digital-based niche. So you could remove that from your list.

The other three niches all have specific physical products associated with them, so they get a ‘yes’ for this question.

Now onto part 2 of this question. Exactly how big of a need does each niche have for products? You could argue that all three have fairly large needs, so for now you can keep considering all of them.

### Question 2: How popular is the niche?

Next, it’s time to [examine the popularity of each niche](https://obstacle.co/blog-niches/). Your answers here won’t necessarily eliminate any niches from your list. Instead, this step is meant to give you a sense of what you’re dealing with.

The problem with this question is that niche products fluctuate in popularity from time to time, so there are no hard-and-fast answers to this. It’s a question you have to answer for yourself. Conducting research on each niche is the best way to accurately analyze its current and future popularity.

But for the sake of argument, I’ll say that custom T-shirts and fidget spinners are very popular while travel products are moderately popular. Again, these terms are subjective, and I’m using them just for this example. In actual practice, you’ll want to have more specific data to compare.

That means you have the biggest chance selling travel-related niche products, but it also doesn’t eliminate the other two entirely. It’s simply a warning sign that those niches (custom T-shirts and fidget spinners) may be _too_ big to break into. Nothing is impossible; some niches are just easier than others for dropshipping.

### Question 3: Is this niche just the result of a passing fad?

This is an easy one. For fidget spinners, you can quickly answer ‘yes’, so that one has to go. Those niche products are definitely part of a fad that won’t carry on into the future.

On the other hand, custom T-shirts and travel products are not fads, so they can stay.

### Question 4: Can I actually add value to this niche?

This question will often decide whether you eliminate a niche or not. You have to put away your dreams of making it big and be brutally honest with yourself. Take any niche you’re seriously considering and ask yourself if you can  [add tons of value with a new online store](https://www.oberlo.com/ebooks/mindset/unique-selling-proposition). Will you be able to fill a need that other merchants aren’t filling? Will you be able to offer something new or different to prospective customers? Will you present or offer niche products that your competitors don’t sell?

This is a difficult question to answer, but in this example, the two niches left (custom T-shirts and travel products) are quite different in terms of market saturation. There’s no question that there are far more custom T-shirt stores than there are travel products stores.

It’s also difficult to add value to a niche when it’s so saturated, and you might find that’s the case with custom T-shirts. You can get any kind of custom T-shirt you can imagine, so you can’t really offer anything unique. However, it’s possible that with excellent design options, you could very well offer something your competitors can’t.

![t-shirt custom dropship](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/t-shirt.png)

This question might take you a while to answer, and that’s par for the course. You’ll also need to think critically and honestly about your ability to add value in niches that are more saturated. Overall, in this example, travel products would be the best choice.

### Question 5: Is the niche sustainable?

But wait! You’re not done yet. You have one step left: make sure the niche is sustainable.

There’s only one niche left: travel products. Travel-related niche products are certainly something people will always need, and people aren’t going to stop traveling anytime soon, so you can confidently say the niche is sustainable.

## Final Thoughts

Before I conclude this chapter, I want to say a few words on the process of niche selection.

I hope this example process has helped you see how to execute these strategies yourself. It won’t always be as easy as this to choose a niche, so be prepared to dig in and do some research. It can be hard to tell if certain niche products are unsustainable or too popular. Trust me when I say that even if you put in a ton of work on this step, it will all pay off in the future.

When you use this process, be thorough. Even if you narrow down your list to one niche early on, you still need to ask the rest of these questions. A good dropshipping niche will always pass this test. Of course, it could be that none of the niches you selected will work for you. That can be a hard pill to swallow because you’ll have to start all over again, but it’s much better than choosing the wrong niche.

Finally, bear in mind that you may need to revisit this step. The next chapter discusses how to select niche products, which is another complex issue in itself. You may find that your ideal niche has a super-crowded product landscape, or that it hasn’t been profitable for a long time.

In those kinds of situations, you might want to go through the niche selection process all over again. This can seem like grunt work, but you have to push through it until you find a profitable, sustainable niche with a good variety of products.

## You’ve Got a Dropshipping Niche! Now What?

Congratulations! You’ve completed one of the toughest steps in the journey!

Next, you have to choose the products you’re going to offer. Before you do so, I recommend taking some time to really familiarize yourself with your niche.

If you already know it inside and out, great. If not, take 7-14 days to study your niche. Take a look at the retailers in the niche, the products they sell, the reviews people give, and the ways people use the products. Get to know the niche from as many perspectives as possible. After that, you can start the process of choosing the best niche products for your store.
## Choosing the Right Products

![dropshipping products](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/drop5.jpg)

Selecting the right dropshipping products is a crucial and difficult step in planning your business. Even if you know what niche you’re going to be entering, you might have little to no idea of which products you should offer.

It doesn’t help that you could carry any number of the millions of products that various wholesalers make available. Furthermore, you want to offer high-demand items that will drive people to your storefront while knowing what  [products to avoid dropshipping](https://www.oberlo.com/videos/products-to-avoid-dropshipping-in-2020).

Ultimately, [your audience will decide](http://www.infoentrepreneurs.org/en/guides/know-your-customers--needs/) which products you should carry. You’ll need to consider what your new customer base is looking for and offer products that meet their needs. To that end, in this chapter you’ll be using different tools to figure out what your audience is buying and which products have risen in demand.

In this chapter, you’ll learn the basics of selling products online and how to find the best dropshipping products for your niche. The ability to conduct valuable  [product research](https://www.oberlo.com/videos/product-research-tips-from-dropshippers)  and analyze trend data will serve you well, and you can even apply these skills to other areas like SEO. Let’s get started by going over the basics.

## The Basics of Selling Products Online

There are some basic truths of products that apply to dropshipping products, and you have to be aware of these if you want to succeed. Specifically, there are certain ways to make money with products, and you have to be using at least one (preferably more) of these strategies:

**Gain rights to exclusive distribution or pricing.** Since you can’t manufacture your own dropshipping products, the next best thing is to acquire exclusive access to  [product distribution](https://www.oberlo.com/ecommerce-wiki/distribution)  or pricing. If you’re the only retailer offering a product (or a special low price for that product), it’ll be easy to generate sales because you’ll have a monopoly on that product or price point. This isn’t always easy to accomplish, but it can be very lucrative if you can manage it.

**Sell at lower prices than your competitors.** This is the approach most dropshippers take: undercut competition by dropshipping products at rock-bottom prices. But this is a business model that will eventually fail. At some point, you won’t be able to sell at such low prices without taking a loss. And just think about having to compete with other retailers, especially giants like Amazon. It’s just not practical, and I don’t recommend doing this.

**Add value.** I’ve already stressed this, but it bears repeating. Many dropshippers don’t even think to add value, which makes this one of the best strategies to use. You might add value with buyers’ guides, professional quality product images, or how-to videos. Whatever you do, it’s important that you can offer some sort of value in addition to dropshipping products that your customers want.

When it comes to dropshipping products, adding value is the surest way to succeed. It’s also the easiest strategy in many respects.

Even if you know how you’re going to add value to your store, you still need to think about things like pricing, marketing, product availability, product demand, and competition. Each of these areas are complex and need to be thoroughly addressed before you move on.

### Pricing

This is a big one. Obviously pricing is something you must consider [carefully](https://www.inc.com/guides/price-your-products.html) if you want to sell products online, but many entrepreneurs don’t give it the attention it deserves. When it comes to dropshipping products, you need to think about how you’re going to price your items and how you _can_ price your items.

![price planning dropshipping](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/pricing.png)

[Image source](http://slideplayer.com/slide/1635659/)

That’s because sometimes there are limits on how you can price your items. Many manufacturers set a minimum advertised price (MAP). If a product has a MAP, it means you, as a reseller, have to price the item at or above that price.

This is a great thing because it prevents retailers from dropshipping products at super-low prices and starting pricing wars. It also levels the playing field among dropshippers, which means you don’t have to lower your prices just to stand out. On the flip side, MAPs limit the amount of profit you can make, but this is a small compromise for the benefits that MAPs bring.

Some manufacturers don’t set MAPs for their items, which makes selling a bit trickier. You could find yourself losing sales because some other store is selling the same product for less. At the same time, lowering your prices would slash your margins even more, so it’s pretty much a lose-lose situation. Overall, products with MAPs are better for your bottom line.

You also want to think about the price range for the items you’ll offer. Although being the cheapest retailer is a bad strategy, you do want to be able to price competitively, and you’ll want to offer items that are accessible to customers.

This is especially true when it comes to dropshipping products that are particularly expensive. Deciding to offer pricey items can present additional issues. If your items are on the pricier side ($500 and up), potential buyers will often want to talk to a sales representative to make sure your store is legitimate and that the product is right for them. So you’ll have to budget for customer support so you can answer customers’ questions and give them peace of mind.

That level of customer support isn’t always practical if you’re a solopreneur bootstrapping everything with just a laptop. That’s why the range of $100 to $200 (give or take $50 or so) is often considered the sweet spot for dropshipping products. You can make a solid profit and offer appealing prices to your customers without having to spend a pretty penny on customer support solutions.

### Marketing

When it comes to dropshipping, marketing is very important. Even if you’re not a marketing veteran, this is still something to spend some time with. You don’t have to create super-detailed marketing strategies at this point, but you should have a general idea of how you’re going to market your products. What channels could you use for marketing? What are other retailers doing? Are there many ways to market the dropshipping products in your niche, or are you limited?

![marketing dropship products](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/marketing.png)

[Image source](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-marketing/chapter/marketing-channels-in-the-supply-chain/)

You can take a page from your competitors’ books by [seeing what kinds of marketing strategies they use](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/25-sneaky-online-tools/) and then analyzing which ones could work for you. You may be surprised at how easy it is to pick out useful strategies and techniques from other retailers. If you’re new to marketing, check out [this blog post](https://www.shopify.com/blog/14512237-13-actionable-marketing-tactics-to-drive-sales-and-apps-to-execute-each-of-them?prev_msid=5178f5b6-14FC-42B5-F117-34B11F31FBA9) that features 13 actionable strategies even a beginner can understand.

When you’re new to dropshipping, marketing is especially important because it’s how you’ll get people to your store. If you don’t market your dropshipping products, you won’t get any traffic. Even if you’re using solutions like Shopify, Amazon, or eBay, you still need to leverage the power of marketing.

While it’s tempting to focus exclusively on  [social media marketing](https://www.oberlo.com/ebooks/facebook-advertising/facebook-ads-strategy), dropshipping businesses also benefit from other types of marketing. Can you set up an email marketing strategy around your store? What about advertisements? [SEO](https://www.oberlo.com/blog/guide-to-seo-101)? Moreover, how are you planning to generate traffic and acquire customers?

This stuff can get a little dry, but it’s best to think about all of this now and not months from now when it’s too late. Being proactive about marketing will help you hit the ground running when your store launches.

### Product Availability

Availability is actually a pretty big factor in deciding which products to offer. When it comes to dropshipping products, it’s important not to choose items which are too easily available.

What do I mean by that? Well, why do most people buy items online? Because they can’t get those items anywhere else. If you’re dropshipping products that are only available online, you’re going to optimize your store to get the most possible sales.

On the other hand, if you’re dropshipping products that are widely available, people have little incentive to buy from your store. This is especially true if customers can get something from a nearby store. This is the idea of scarcity in action, and it’s important for driving sales.

For example, if a customer needs products like paper towels or hand soap, they’ll likely head down to their local big box store. But if they’re looking for a good deal on, say, a high-capacity SD card or a custom phone case, they’ll probably look online instead. This basically boils down to convenience; if it’s more convenient for customers to order online, they will.

When you sell products online, offering items like USB chargers or cutlery isn’t always profitable. These are items you can easily obtain at most brick-and-mortar stores, so it’s more convenient to purchase them in real life instead of online. This doesn’t mean you can’t sell _any_ items that are easily available, but you definitely shouldn’t rely only on such products.

### Product Demand

If a product doesn’t have sufficient demand, it might be a dud. Demand is a [basic rule of economics](http://smallbusiness.chron.com/market-research-used-analyze-demand-1506.html), but it’s even more important when it comes to dropshipping products. Basically, demand is even more important for dropshipping than it is for other forms of online retail.

![product demand](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/product-demand.png)

[Image source](https://fyi.uwex.edu/downtown-market-analysis/analysis-of-opportunities-by-sector/retail-service-businesses/)

In a niche market, there’s more room to work with dropshipping products that have less demand. Think about action figures of characters from movies. That’s an incredibly niche market, and in the large scheme of things there’s a low level of demand, but the prices offset that low demand. If you’re a hobbyist or collector who’s not too interested in dropshipping, this isn’t a problem.

However, if you want a sustainable business, the best dropshipping products are those that are in moderately high to very high demand. Selling action figures isn’t going to pay the bills consistently, even though it may pay well. You want items that have steady levels of demand.

Later on in this chapter, I’ll show you how to gauge demand by using various online tools and resources. When it’s time to seek out  [potential products](https://www.oberlo.com/videos/5-plus-1-huge-potential-products-with-500k-dropshipper-emma-reid)  for your store, you’ll have to know these crucial skills.

### Competition

If you want to sell products online, you need to stand out from the other stores that are just like yours. You have to study your competitors and discover where their weaknesses lie. The goal is to essentially one-up them by doing things that they’re not doing. Researching your competition is a huge part of understanding how your niche’s product landscape looks and how you can break in.

![analyzing competition](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/analysing-competitors.png)

[Image source](http://www.launchengineering.com/CompetitionAnalysis.htm)

When I say study, I mean it. I’m talking deep analysis of what your competitors sell, how they market themselves, what their websites look like, and so much more. Like marketing and product research,  [competitor analysis is ongoing](https://www.oberlo.com/ecommerce-wiki/competitive-analysis). As your rivals change their strategies and offer different dropshipping products, you’ll want to keep an eye out because these actions could signify changes in trends.

All of this makes up the basics of selling products online. I’m going to get even more in depth in this chapter because dropshipping requires you to approach selling in a very targeted manner.

## Finding High-Demand Products

As I mentioned earlier, demand is central to building a great dropshipping business. In fact, demand is a big reason why dropshipping can be so lucrative.

Selling low-demand products is a dead end, so you want to ensure that you find products that have a significant level of demand. But how do you do this?

You can evaluate demand by using online tools and by researching retailers within your niche. Both of these methods are invaluable for scouting the best dropshipping products with huge  [profit potential](https://www.oberlo.com/videos/dropshipping-products-huge-profit-potential), and you’ll always be able to use these techniques once you get them down.

First, let’s go over some of the best online tools for product selection.

### Google Keyword Planner

When it comes to finding the best dropshipping products for your niche, [conducting keyword research is an excellent method](https://www.oberlo.com/ecommerce-wiki/keyword-research). Keywords will reveal which products are being searched for. While you can’t always tell if these products are selling, typically a high search volume means a product is performing well.

Now you might not know anything about keyword research. That’s okay! You don’t need any prior knowledge to start searching like a pro. It’s all in the tools you use, and the ones I’ve gathered here are some of the best.

I’ll start with [Google Keyword Planner](https://adwords.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/).

There’s a reason Keyword Planner is one of the most used keyword tools in the world. It’s perhaps the most accessible keyword resource on the internet (and it’s Google). It’s also free, although you have to have an active ad campaign to use the planner.

The downsides? The data is fairly general and not too comprehensive. You’ll want to supplement the results you get with results from other tools (which is why I’m talking about multiple tools here). That said, Keyword Planner is an excellent start, and it’s definitely a tool you should use regularly.

First, head to [https://adwords.google.com](https://adwords.google.com/) and make sure you’re logged into the right account.

Next, make sure you have an active ad campaign. You’ll be able to see this in your AdWords dashboard. A campaign (or multiple campaigns) should appear in this section of the page:

![Google keyword planner find niche](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/keyword-planner.png)

If you don’t see any campaigns listed here, you’ll need to create one by hitting the ‘+ AD GROUP’ button and filling out the next few pages.

Once you have a campaign set up, head to the menu at the top of the screen. Click on ‘Tools’ and then ‘Keyword Planner’.

![how to find dropshipping niche with AdWords keyword planner](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/keyword-planner-2.png)

You should see this screen:

![Get niche ideas with google adwords](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/keyword-planner-3.png)

#### The Simple Way to Research Keywords

If you want to take a quick look at search volume, or how much certain terms are being searched, click on ‘Get search volume data and trends’.

![research keywords AdWords](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/keyword-planner-4.png)

Next, enter the search terms you want to look up. If you have a lot of keywords, you can upload a CSV, TSV, or text file, and the keyword tool will do all of the heavy lifting for you.

![find new keywords ](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/keyword-planner-5.png)

You can also target certain locations, choose to include Google’s search partners, and specify a date range. (As for that last option called ‘Negative keywords’, I’ll look at that later on in this chapter.)

![what are negative keywords](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/keyword-planner-6.png)

When you’re finished modifying the settings, hit ‘Get search volume’.

Here’s our example result: ![search volume dropshipping keywords](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/keyword-planner-7.png)

This can look complex if you’re not used to it, so here’s how you should read this page.

Let’s focus just on the chart at the bottom.

![keywords ideas dropship](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/keyword-planner-8.png)

The keywords you searched are on the far left side under the category ‘Keyword (by relevance)’.

The _Avg. monthly searches_ displays the monthly search volume for that keyword. To the right, the _Competition_ category gives you an idea of how competitive each keyword is. These two categories work in tandem to provide you with a big picture view of every keyword.

In this example, ‘water bottle’ has a monthly search volume of 100,000 to 1,000,000, while both ‘insulated water bottle’ and ‘smart water bottle’ are in the 10,000 to 100,000 range.

Now, these are huge ranges, which can present a problem when you’re trying to figure out which dropshipping products are being searched. There’s a big difference between a product that gets 10,000 searches a month and another product that gets _ten times_ that.

That’s why this is the simple way. This can give you a rough idea of how popular certain dropshipping products are, but to get the most specific information, you’ll want to use the in-depth way of looking at keywords using Google’s tool.

#### The In-Depth Way to Research Keywords

The in-depth method starts off the same way as the simple method. Head to your AdWords home page. Click on Tools and then Keyword Planner.

Next, choose ‘Enter or upload a list of keywords to get forecasts’.

![advanced way to do keyword research](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/keyword-planner-9.png)

This next step is almost identical to the simple way: enter your keywords and modify the fields as you want to. You can also choose languages here if you need to.

When you’re done, click ‘Get forecasts’.

For this method, you’ll need to enter a bid. If you already used the simple way, you can use one of the suggested bids here.

![keyword planner suggested bids](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/keyword-planner-10.png)

Next, click the Keyword tab located right above the graph.

![](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/keyword-planner-11.png)

Scroll down, and you’ll see a chart that looks like this:

![google adwords keyword results](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/keyword-planner-12.png)

Here you’ll see much more detailed information about the search terms.

You can see how many clicks the terms are receiving, their click-through rates (CTRs), average cost-per-click (CPC), and more.

This is invaluable information that gives you more precise insight into the keywords you’re researching. You can also adjust all of the parameters, including bid amount, date range, and locations.

I know this seems like a lot, but the whole procedure is a lot faster than you might think. In time, you’ll be able to crush tons of keyword searches in just a few minutes. This is a great method of getting detailed keyword results without having to study SEO for months.

#### Get Long-Tail Keyword Ideas

Another handy use of Keyword Planner is [generating long-tail keywords](https://www.wordstream.com/long-tail-keywords). Long-tail keywords are super-specific variations on keywords that usually make up most of a site’s search volume.

For example, if ‘water bottle’ is your focus keyword, some long-tails might be ‘best water bottle for camping’ and ‘reusable water bottles’. They’re closely related to (and often include) the focus keyword. Most people will be using long-tails to search.

Finding long-tails will help you find other potential dropshipping products that could be smash hits for your store. Here’s how to do it using Keyword Planner.

In AdWords, navigate to _Tools > Keyword Planner_. Select ‘Search for new keywords using a phrase, website or category’.

![long tail keyword ideas](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/keyword-planner-13.png)

On the next page, enter a focus keyword in the box that says ‘Your product or service’. Fill out the rest of the forms as well.

![how to find long tail keywords](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/keyword-planner-14.png)

Pay special attention to the ‘Customize your search’ section in the lower right hand corner. You can get super precise with your search here.

![keyword filters AdWords](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/keyword-planner-15.png)

When you’re finished filling everything out, click ‘Get ideas’.

Scroll down a little bit on the next page, and you’ll see a chart that looks like this:

![keyword results Google PPC](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/keyword-planner-16.png)

These are all keywords that Google found based on the focus keyword you entered. You can see the average monthly search volume, competition level, and suggested bid.

Even better, you can take these keywords and run them through the in-depth method mentioned above. This will let you analyze just how popular various products are.

One last tip: If you set up a dummy campaign to use Keyword Planner, make sure you go back in and remove it.

All in all, Google Keyword Planner is a fairly formidable tool for finding potential dropshipping products if you use it the right way. It arms you with some basic figures that you can use to start understanding which products are successful and which ones are dwindling in popularity.

### Google Trends

Trends is another free Google tool that can be very helpful for selecting products. It especially comes in handy for taking the product ideas you’ve found through Keyword Planner and more thoroughly analyzing them.

Head over to [https://trends.google.com](https://trends.google.com/) and enter a search term in the box. When you search, you’ll see a few options in a dropdown menu. Start by choosing ‘search term’.

The next page will give you results based on your search term. There’s a lot to take in here, so let’s go over the most useful elements.

First, you’ll see a graph called _Interest over time_.

![Google trends dropshipping niche](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/google-trends-1.png)

This is a super-useful visual of search volume over a time period that you can specify. You can also change the location, date range, category, and search type.

This graph can help you understand if your products are seasonal or not. Many products spike in popularity during a certain time of year, and if any products you’re considering do so, you’ll want to know in advance.

Check out the bump in this graph:

![Google trends identify niches for dropshipping](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/google-trends-2.png)

This means that most people buy apple butter during September and October. During the rest of the year, apple butter purchases stay at a steady rate. This is definitely a seasonal product.

Next on this page, you can see _Interest by region_. This is helpful for understanding where you might be getting the bulk of your orders from, and this can even give you a clue how often you’ll have to use international shipping.

At the bottom of the page, you’ll see two sections called _Related topics_ and _related queries_. Here you can get even more ideas for dropshipping products! These sections basically give you long-tail topics and search terms that you can look into. (They’re also useful for SEO and marketing.)

Finally, don’t overlook the Compare feature all the way at the top. It lets you compare two or more search terms. It’s extremely convenient for deep analysis.

![top selling dropshipping products](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/google-trends-3.png)

Overall, Trends gives you a different perspective. While its comparative features are noteworthy, there’s a lot to love about this free tool.

### SEMrush

Want even more data? Comfortable with upping your SEO game? Then have a look at SEMrush. It’s a much more comprehensive keyword tool that almost every professional SEO has used at one point or another. It can give you incredibly specific information about keywords, so you can grab keywords from Keyword Planner and enter them into SEMrush to get all the details. It’s nothing short of an SEO powerhouse.

The only caveat: You can only conduct 10 searches per day. You also only get 10 results for each category. This can be limiting if you want a super-thorough analysis.

I still recommend SEMrush for its sheer power and usefulness. A paid plan will help you get the most out of the software, but realistically, the free plan will work for more dropshippers just starting out. Unless you have extra money burning a hole in your pocket, go with the free plan to start with.

Head to [SEMrush.com](https://www.semrush.com/) and enter a keyword into the main search bar in the middle of the page and click ‘Start Now’.

![how to use SEMRush](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/semrush1.png)

You’ll see an analytics page that looks like this:

![SEMrush analytics page](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/semrush2.png)

Here you can see four important headings: Organic Search, Paid Search, CPC Distribution, and Trend.

Organic Search will show you the search volume (i.e., the average monthly searches for that keyword) for search that happens organically. This means that the company didn’t spend money to bring in those searches. This category is key because it will reflect how many people are naturally using the keyword without the influence of any ads or campaigns.

Paid Search is also important since it will give you the average CPC (cost per click) for the keyword. This amount represents how much you’ll pay on average for someone to click on your ad. This isn’t an exact number, but it will give you a sense of how much you’re looking at spending.

Wondering what CPC Distribution is? CPC distribution represents how expensive it is to bid on a particular keyword across the different PPC platforms. Clicking on a bar will give you more data.

Finally, the Trend section represents the level of competition for that keyword. A score of 1 is the highest level of competition, while 0 means it has virtually no competition. Note that the Trend section only analyzes _paid_ search, although SEMrush says it can reflect organic search as well.

Scroll down on this page, and you’ll see another section with two sections labeled Phrase Match Keywords and Related Keywords.

![SEMrush related and phase match keywords](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/semrush3.png)

The Phrase Match Keywords include your target keyword in them. As you can see, the example target keyword I initially entered was ‘travel water bottles’, and the Phrase Match Keywords include ‘best travel water bottle’ and ‘filter water bottle for travel’.

The Related Keywords section shows you keywords that are similar to your target keyword but do not necessarily include it. Some of these may be close, like ‘best water bottles for travel’.

Both of these sections are great for generating long-tail keyword ideas, and you can see the volume and CPC as well. As a nice bonus, if you click on the little blue icons under the SERP heading, you’ll open up a Google search for that keyword. This gives you a nice visual of what the search page looks like for a given keyword.

Scroll some more, and you’ll see another really helpful section titled Organic Search Results.

![organic search results SEMrush](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/semrush4.png)

This is really useful because it shows you the top 100 organic results for that keyword. As I said earlier, organic traffic is essential to look at because it reflects customer interest in a product. This section will filter out all of the paid ad placements you see on Google search pages, so you see only the top organic results.

There’s one more part of the SEMrush analytics page that is particularly useful in a dropshipping context. If you look to the right of the Organic Search Results section, you’ll see a bunch of data about ads:

![SEMrush competitor ad analysis](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/semrush5.png)

Whereas Organic Search Results focused only on non-paid search, this section looks at paid search.

Ads Copies will show you a few examples of ad copy for some of the top paid search ads. Here you can see four ads taken straight from the Google page, and you can conveniently see what copy they’ve used.

This is great for getting intel on your competition, and while it’s no match for all-out competitive analysis, it’s certainly a handy reference point that gives you a quick overview. It can also give you some ideas for some ad copy for your own products!

Right below, you can see the Product Ads Copies category that displays pictorial ads for a couple of products. This section looks simple, and it might not seem like you can get a lot from it, but I’ll break this down and show you how valuable this can be.

First, you can see the title of the product. At first glance, this seems plain, but look deeper and you’ll discover that you can take another peek into your competitors’ SEO playbooks. That’s because every product title is optimized for SEO, often containing keywords that are performing well in that niche.

In this case, notice how both of these products contain the word ‘collapsible’. This suggests that ‘collapsible travel water bottle’ and other variants are doing well. If you were selling water bottles, you might want to look into offering collapsible bottles on your store and using those keywords. So you not only get a keyword idea but also a product idea, all from a few words.

Second, these ad snippets display the price and the site selling them. This is another miniature form of competitive analysis. You can see who some of your competitors are and how they’re pricing their products. Again, this information will only give you a rough guideline, but it’s a convenient snapshot that you should look at whenever you’re using SEMrush.

The last section on this page is the Ads History category.

![ads history SEMrush](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/semrush6.png)

This shows how actively websites were bidding on keywords. If you click on a bar, you’ll see more information about which sites were bidding and how much they were bidding.

I recommend using the Ads History graph to complement the knowledge you gained from Google Trends. SEMrush uses different databases than Google Trends, and it’s always helpful to get data from a wide range of different sources.

Learning to digest the SEMrush results page can be a little intimidating at first, so if you need some help, I suggest consulting [this page from the SEMrush Knowledge Base](https://www.semrush.com/kb/257-keyword-overview). In addition, there are several Knowledge Base articles available that will familiarize you with the tool in no time.

### Competitors’ Sites

Before you analyze your competitors, you can use their sites to get even more information on product trends. You’ve probably guessed it by now, but there’s a targeted approach to this technique that produces the best results.

Have your list of potential dropshipping products handy. Visit several (7-10) retailers’ sites and take a look at their top products. Usually, there will be a dropdown box on the store page that will allow you to sort products so that best selling items show first.

![SEMrush competitor discovery](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/site-comparison.png)

This will rearrange the product page so that the best selling items are listed first. In other words, the absolute best seller will be the first result and so on.

Keep in mind that sorting this way will show you the best-selling products _of all time_. It won’t show you the items that have sold the most over the last month or year. It’s not the most helpful way to search for products, but it’s still worthwhile.

You might also see some stores highlighting products or marking them as ‘top sellers’.

![top sellers semrush](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/site-comparison-2.png)

These are also products to pay attention to and record on a list. This typically means the products are currently trending, and they’ll likely change over time. This is good to remember because if you notice a certain product that stays in a top seller category, it may mean that item sells consistently well.

Gather this data from as many stores as possible, and organize it all on a spreadsheet for easy access. I recommend using separate spreadsheets (or at least separate categories) for all of the keywords and data you get from each online tool. This way, you can continuously compile data from each tool and keep it separate for easy reference.

That’s going to wrap up the keyword research section of this chapter. Now I’ll show you how to analyze your competitors so you know what you’re up against. Fair warning – if you’re not too familiar with SEO, you’ll need to spend a little time learning some basic concepts and terms, but it’s easy for anyone to tackle.

## Analyse Your Competitors

Once you have some dropshipping products selected, you’ll need to scope out your competitors. This serves a twofold purpose:

1) It allows you to pinpoint your top competitors, which means you can start thinking about how you can get sales instead of them.

2) It gives you a practical understanding of which products are selling the best.

Getting lots of keywords is great, but sizing up your competition is just as necessary. Since you’re brand new to your niche, you’ll be learning a lot from your competitors, and you can also analyze and then implement some of their techniques for areas like marketing and SEO.

Thankfully, you can easily conduct competitive analysis using little more than Google. This is because Google’s rankings are more or less indicative of how popular different retailers are. The higher up a site is on the [SERPs](https://fitsmallbusiness.com/what-is-a-serp-how-google-search-works/), the more powerful it is, so retailers with high SERP positions are typically leaders in their niches.

Because Google is set up like this, you can get a surface level view of your competition by simply Googling a product name and seeing which retailers come up. This won’t give you exact statistics, so you need to use some additional tools to get the real juicy data.

### Moz Open Site Explorer

Moz is one of the biggest names in SEO, and its Open Site Explorer tool is one of the best free SEO tools available. Often abbreviated to OSE, this is a link analysis tool that gives you a ton of information about a website. You can see how popular the website is, how much traffic it gets, and how many backlinks it has. (You can even get details on where those backlinks come from!) It’s unparalleled for understanding how influential your competitors are.

To take full advantage of all that OSE has to offer, you first have to understand a few terms and concepts. You don’t have to be a trained SEO to get a good grasp of this, so don’t fret if you don’t have much experience.

The main concepts are Domain Authority, Page Authority, and link structure. The best way to show you what all of these are is to see them in action.

First, go to [https://moz.com/researchtools/ose](https://moz.com/researchtools/ose). Enter a URL into the search bar in the middle of the page and click ‘Search’.

You’ll see a results page that looks like this:

![Moz site explorer dropship](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/moz1.png)

To start off, look at just the category titled _Authority_.

![moz page authority](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/moz2-1.png)

There are three important metrics here: Domain Authority, Page Authority, and Spam Score.

**Domain Authority** (DA) is a metric that Moz developed to display how well a domain will rank in search engines. 100 is the best possible DA score.

Basically, the higher a site’s DA score, the more likely a site is to rank well. If your site has a DA of 90, you can usually expect to rank on page 1. On the other hand, if your site has a DA of 25, it probably won’t rank too well.

DA is best for considering the general impact of a site. A high DA means that the site gets a high amount of traffic to its homepage and most of its other pages. That’s why sites with higher DA scores will usually be your top competitors.

Keep in mind that DA is not the final word on how a site will rank. It’s simply a benchmark. You also don’t need a high DA to rank on page 1 of the SERPs. Specific pages may rank better than the overall site they belong to, which brings me to the next metric…

**Page Authority** (PA) is nearly identical to Domain Authority, except it analyzes the ranking strength of individual pages. This allows you to predict how well certain pages on your site (or on your competitors’ sites) will rank.

PA is useful for understanding the impact of a certain product page. When you enter in a specific URL, you’ll want to look at the PA score to see how powerful that page is.

It’s good to check the PA scores of best selling product pages and compare those to the overall DA of the site. If both are high, that means the site gets a lot of traffic and probably sells a lot. If PA is high but DA is low, the site doesn’t get a lot of traffic but likely sells certain items more than others.

Finally, **Spam Score** checks to make sure a site is legitimate. Moz can tell when a site is set up for spam purposes, and that’s where this signal comes in. 0 is where you want to be.

To recap everything so far: High DA and PA scores are good, while a low spam score is ideal. Together, these three metrics will give you an idea of how well a site will rank.

Now let’s move on to the section called _Page Link Metrics_.

![page link metrics moz](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/moz3-1.png)

The _Just-Discovered_ section can indicate how popular a site or page has become in the last 60 days. If you see a high number here, it means the site has gained a lot of backlinks in the last couple of months.

The _Established Links_ section is even more valuable. It shows you how many root domains and total links there are.

The number of **root domains** shows you how many unique domains have linked to the site, while **total links** include any and all links, not just root domains. So if fakewebsite.com linked to your site twice, it would count as one root domain and two total links (since it’s the same domain linking multiple times).

A site with a high number of root domains will usually rank very well for several terms. This is generally the more important metric of the two. Why? Because Google prefers sites with lots of unique root domains and will rank them higher than sites with fewer root domain links.

With that said, the number of total links can also help gauge how impactful a site is, since a high number of total links means the site has probably gotten multiple links from the same sites. This number also reflects the site’s total reach and influence.

At the bottom, you can see the specific inbound links (i.e., links pointing to the specific site or page). You can also filter results in case you want to see specific link types, which can be useful.

![moz inbound links](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/moz4-1.png)

There are a couple of reasons you might want to find out who is linking to your competitors.

First, it shows you which sites you might be able to get backlinks from. Maybe you’ll find some sites that feature dropshipping products or use affiliate programs to connect with retailers. Later on, when you’re building an SEO strategy of your own, this information is nice to have.

Second, you can personally check the credibility and quality of each backlink. For example, a site might get a ton of links but they could all come from shady sites. On the other hand, if popular sites are linking, then you’ll want to pay attention to the competitor you’re researching.

There’s one more item of note on this page: the _Compare Link Metrics_ option. This is located in the menu on the left hand side:

![compare link metrics moz](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/moz5.png)

This feature allows you to compare multiple sites and see how their metrics stack up. For competitive analysis, this is a goldmine. You can pit your site directly against your competitors’ or even compare multiple competitors against each other.

Simply click ‘Add URL’, enter the address, and you’ll get a neat chart with all the important metrics listed.

![moz page specific metrics](https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/moz6.png)

Don’t overlook this feature. It’s one of my favorites for comparing competitors and seeing how my site is doing. All in all, OSE is a stellar resource, and it’ll quickly become a part of your daily business routine.

### PageRank Checkers

PageRank (PR) is an algorithm Google uses to rank pages on the search engine results pages (or SERPs). While PR is one of many ranking signals, it provides a good indicator of ranking power. It’s similar to DA, except PR is the metric Google uses. Some SEOs argue this is more important because it comes directly from Google.

PR is scored on a 1 to 10 scale, with 10 being the highest, signifying an extremely high-ranking site. Most sites have a PR of 1-4, and it can take a while to get a new site into the higher end of the scale.

PR can be a mysterious metric because Google no longer makes the scores available to the public. However, it’s still an important piece of the ranking puzzle because Google uses the metric and will continue to do so and has no plans of changing that.

You can use sites like [CheckPageRank.net](https://www.checkpagerank.net/) to see how your site fares. These third party sites won’t necessarily be 100% accurate, so I suggest using PR scores in tandem with Moz metrics to get a holistic view of how sites rank. Like DA, PR isn’t a conclusive score. It’s another helpful benchmark to have around.

## Wrapping it up: 3 steps for selecting dropshipping products

I’ve gone over a ton of material in this chapter, and it can feel intimidating to have so much to tackle.

To make it easy, I’ve condensed everything into a 3-step process that will help you find the best dropshipping products for your store. You’ll want to reference the detailed instructions above, of course. Over time, as you repeat this process, it will become second nature.

### Step 1: Survey all of the products in your niche.

First, you want to take a large-scale look at your niche. What categories of dropshipping products do you find? What specific products are being sold? What does this all mean for you (i.e., what products could you offer based on this research)?

Use tools like Google Keyword Planner, Google Trends, and SEMrush to see how various products are performing. Record all of this data in a spreadsheet. I suggest keeping separate spreadsheets for each keyword tool you use to make sure all your data is organized.

Don’t worry about looking at specific retailers just yet during this step. You don’t even have to determine if the retailers you visit are dropshipping products or not. This step is meant to give you a look at of all the different products that are being sold in the niche

Once you’ve gathered some keyword and dropshipping product ideas, you’re ready for Step 2.

### Step 2: Cross-reference the products you found with best selling products from retailers.

Now’s the time to take a closer look at retailers in your niche. The goal is to find out which products are popular and which ones are on the rise.

This is when you should conduct competitive analysis by using tools like Moz Open Site Explorer and PageRank checkers. You’ll want a separate spreadsheet for this step to compile the data from OSE and PageRank tools.

If you want, you can take a closer look at your biggest competition and cross-reference your product data from Step 1. This can help you confirm which products are selling well (and thus which products you might want to sell).

Don’t place your orders just yet! You’re still not done finding the best dropshipping products for your store. There’s still one more step left…

### Step 3: Make sure the products fill a need.

This is the step most dropshippers skip. They identify the top selling products and throw up listings on a site. Maybe that was even your first instinct. However, there are many problems with simply dropshipping products that sell well. A best-selling product isn’t always the one that people need the most, but obviously you want products that fly off the shelves. How do you balance these elements?

If you want to sell products online, it’s important to make sure [your audience has a need](https://go.forrester.com/blogs/13-10-15-seven_steps_to_a_needs_based_marketing_strategy/) for every product you offer. If you’re dropshipping products that people need, those products will sell. That’s almost guaranteed. But if you offer products with a history of selling well, there’s no guarantee that those products will do the same for you. That’s why you should start by considering consumer need.

How do you make sure people need a certain product? Take a look at what they’re saying. Visit websites, groups, forums, social media pages, and other channels to see how much conversation is happening for any given product.

You want to see people positively discussing the product. Good reviews and product-related questions are good signs. If you can find a community around the product (or type of product), that’s even better. The product in question should be helping people do something specific.

If there’s a lack of discussion (or negative discussion) about a product, some further research may be necessary. A complete absence of buzz around a product means you should think twice about offering it.

More often than not, it will be fairly easy to tell if a product is filling a need. Here’s a good test – try to state the benefit of the product in one sentence.

Here are some examples:

-   “This smart thermostat will help you control your home’s temperature right from your phone.”
-   “This mug will keep your drink hotter for longer.”
-   “This chair will reduce back pain and make you comfortable.”

Don’t stress out on this step. You don’t need to be writing ad copy for the product. You just want to understand what a product does and [how it helps your customers](http://www.convinceandconvert.com/social-media-strategy/15-important-tips-to-help-you-keep-your-customers/).

If you can’t summarize the product’s benefit in one sentence, that could be problematic. The majority of helpful, valuable products are easy to describe, and their value is easy to understand. And if you can see the value of a product, your customers certainly will.

## Product Selection Is Ongoing

Now you’ll have a list of great dropshipping products (and the data to back it up). You should also understand why these products are valuable and what specific value they offer to customers in your niche. Don’t think about product sourcing just yet. I’ll address that a little later on in this guide.

If you’re having trouble, go back through the steps once more and try to take a more targeted approach. Consider searching for more specific product ideas or keywords, or perhaps expand the scope of your competitive analysis by finding more retailers to research.

The skills outlined in this chapter are skills I use every day, and they’re incredibly useful for any dropshipper. I especially want to encourage you to get to know the various online tools. Knowing all the little features of tools like Keyword Planner and Moz OSE can really take your dropshipping store to the next level.

Don’t forget that product selection is an ongoing process. This won’t be the last time you measure product demand and competition. If new dropshipping products show up and people start buying them, you’ll obviously want to consider carrying [those products](https://www.oberlo.com/blog/unique-dropshipping-products-sell-2018). It’s a good idea to set aside some time each month or so to conduct product research. Many experienced dropshipping merchants conduct product research on a biweekly or even weekly basis to keep their finger on the pulse of the market.

You’ve done a lot so far! At this point, you have all the makings of a great business. You’ve done your research, chosen a niche, and picked out products. A good amount of the grunt work is over, so give yourself a pat on the back for all that you’ve accomplished so far.

The only thing stopping you from getting started is, well, setting up your business! You’ll need to take some important steps before you go on the hunt for suppliers and source your products. [Chapter 6](https://www.oberlo.com/ebooks/dropshipping/opening-business)  will introduce you to vital concepts that deal with making your business official so you can start dropshipping products and profiting from your work.
