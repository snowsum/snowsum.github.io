# introduction
Please allow me to get started by two quotes. The first one explains why i am looking for such a job that xxxx is offering. Second quote tells who i am and my attitude towards life and work.

To be radical open, i want to find more about myself and dig deeper into LED industry by changing my role to sourcing /purchasing from sales/marketing. And i think i will and could handle the new role backing by my 5 years experience in LED lighting industry and over-a-year stay in America, New York, Florida, Texas, you name it.

Starting from 2014, I have attended dozens of global trade shows, visited hundreds of accounts and explored a lot of stores(big or small) through out the state. By talking with customers face to face, I get to know their real demand and genuine thoughts about different products offered by vavious suppliers in China, Over time, I know the LED market, know the customer, know products, know chinese vendors, and know myself.

>Rule 1. Don't stop when you are tired. Stop when you are done.

# summarise
To summeraise, David Wu is a young man with about 5 years experience in LED industry, and he probably understands the US market and  Chinese vendors better than most salesman in China thanks to his over-a-year stay in America.
Plus, he is a big fun of sports(basket ball), an English lover and a father. and tell you what, he wont stop when he is tired, he stops when he is done.
