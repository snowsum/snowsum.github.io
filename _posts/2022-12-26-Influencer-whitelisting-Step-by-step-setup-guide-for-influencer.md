How to set up an Influencer’s Business Manager for Whitelisting access:

1.  The influencer creates a Facebook Business Manager by going to  [www.business.facebook.com](http://www.business.facebook.com/)  and logging into their Facebook profile

4.  Accept the confirmation email sent to the Business Manager’s associated email from Step 2 to complete the Business Manager setup.

7.  Assuming there is an existing page, enter the Facebook Page name or URL to be claimed by the Business Manager and click “Add Page”.  **_Note:_** _the influencer will need to have admin access to the Page they are claiming. If they do not have admin access, someone with admin access will need to grant the Business Manager permission to claim the page._

Once the influencer’s Business Manager is set up and the accounts are claimed, they’ll need to assign your brand “partner access” to the Instagram and Facebook accounts:

1.  Select “Pages” from the left-hand menu
2.  Select “Assign Partners” and then either enter the Advertiser’s Business Manager ID or create a link to request partner access.  **_Note:_** _the Business ID will need to be shared with the influencer before they are able to give whitelisting access to their Facebook Page. Alternatively,_ they can email the share link by clicking “Get Link to Share”. From there, you’ll need to accept the invite.

4.  Select “Instagram accounts” from the left side of the page, then select “Add Partners”, then enter the advertiser’s Business Manager ID.  **_Note:_** _the Business ID will need to be shared to the influencer before they are able to give whitelisting access to their Instagram account._

Once your influencers complete the setup, their Facebook Page and Instagram accounts will populate in your brand’s Business Manager.  
‍

Then, you’ll need to assign the proper users access to the influencer channels to create Facebook and Instagram dark posts from the whitelisted content.
