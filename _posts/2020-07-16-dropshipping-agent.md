**Dropshipping agents are everywhere but should you work with them?**

There are now many dropshipping agents offering their services all over the internet. These are individuals or companies based in China who work as the middleman between dropshipppers and manufacturers. They deal with AliExpress wholesalers and other Chinese manufacturers and provide a range of services that range from product sourcing to order fulfillment. The question is, do you really need them?

It is tough to compete with other dropshipping businesses nowadays. As anyone with a computer and a small amount of money can start dropshipping anytime, the competition keeps on increasing every day. Breaking through the noise to catch shopper’s attention will take more skills, time, and money. Advertising and marketing will cost much than building a dropshipping store. If they are not done correctly, you may not see returns even weeks of running campaigns.

I say this not to scare you away from dropshipping, but it’s the hard truth that you have to recognize and accept if you want to survive and succeed in this industry. Those who want to make dropshipping work for them find ways to get an edge over their competitors, and one strategy is to hire dropshipping agents to do the legwork for them. Dropshippers who use this strategy believe that there are more advantages to working with dropshipping agents than negotiating online with dropshipping suppliers on AliExpress. Will it do you good working with them? Let’s find out!



### Why dropshippers hire dropshipping agents?

Dropshipping overseas particularly in China does not give you the luxury to negotiate face-to-face with manufacturers or suppliers. You cannot visit their warehouses and check the quality of their products yourself without flying to China, and this will take more money and time to do. It is something that most dropshippers don’t have at the moment. The inability to spend more money is the main reason why they choose to dropship products in the first place.

Some dropshippers hire dropshipping agents based in China to do the things that they cannot do themselves at a lesser cost and these include:

-   _Finding reputable suppliers with premium quality products and reliable customer service._
-   _Overcoming communication issues that often arise in negotiating with foreigners._
-   _Ensuring fast delivery of the correct, undamaged products to customers._
-   _Picking products without manufacturer’s or brand’s logo._
-   _Taking photos and videos of the dropshipping products they want to sell._

3.  _Buying products from local marketplaces or China-exclusive platforms like Taobao._

7. _Can ship out tons of parcels in very short time, good for those gurus who are scalling their business ,working with influencer or campaining._

Working with dropshipping agents have many advantages yet, there are certain disadvantages to consider too.

-   _If you are a new commer to dropshipping business, without stable daily orders,they might not going to support you._
-   _You’ll be required to buy stock(2-3days) so they can process the orders once they get your orders._
