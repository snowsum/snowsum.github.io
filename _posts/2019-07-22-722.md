### 开发信 tips
1.  围绕客户展开而不是你自己，获取展示的机会，而不是一上来就展示。
2.  开发信有血有肉有生活，不仅仅是数据
3.  提供价值资讯
4.  探求客户痛点：和现在供应商有什么问题，我们能怎样改进

### Mail 1

Hi Mark,

 
Thank you for your effort to fight contamination in South America. （意外）

 
"Who are you?"

Well, hope this mail finds you well. This is Lee from XXX, we're a professional drinkware manufacturer.

 
I learned about your brand by accident on Google. Attracted by the design and after studying your product line & story for around 30 minutes, I found out that F**(客户品牌，不是Fu*k) is exactly the customer that we want to work with.

Because you don't only care about business but also the environment. (fund the project of MPSA) We do care about brands who are dedicated to protecting the planet. （与客户的过往建立联系）

 
We could definitely build something together by offering customers more innovative stainless-steel bottles, and the profit can be used to fund more protection agency.

Actually, we have the experience of helping some recognizable Europe brands just like F** from 0 to 1. And now their business is keeping growing.

 
Last but not least, I'm a young man just like you, who also cares about the brand and likes learning. Moreover, Just like you, I spend my spare time reading and play with my doggy Little W.

 
Martin, I'm sure we can do something together; reply to this mail and let's start a new story!(客户领英介绍原文）

 
P.S. You'll see my dog Little W In the next email. (放下一个小钩“狗”子）

```
### Mail 2
```
Hi Lee, 

Thank you for the email. I am glad that we share similar values and a similar vision. We are currently evaluating a new purchase, as business has been growing and we are looking to expand. We would love to hear about your product offerings. Could you send me a catalog to my email for me to analyze and get back to you? 

Thank you. 

```
### Mail 3

Hi Mark,

It’s 11:40 PM here and I’m excited to have your positive feedback!!

Yeah I totally agree that we’re sharing the similar values & vision that’s why I’m writing with enthusiasm.

I’m so glad to hear that your business is growing, you really deserve to it who cares about our planet so much.

Well, I’ll select the suitable catalog and send you in soon when I get back to the office tomorrow morning. I’m sure you’ll love them :)

By the way, if I’m understanding properly, you’re buying from China, right? Is there anything that the current supplier should perform better? Pricing, delivery or anything else needs to be improved?（此处运用SPIN难点问题提问法，挖掘客户的隐性需求，收集更多的信息为日后谈判做铺垫）

Thanks & discuss more soon,

并且紧接着我又发了一封邮件：

Oh Mark, as promised, attached is my doggy Little W.

(He is much bigger than last year and grows to 30  KG now 😅)

客户：Nice dog!!
