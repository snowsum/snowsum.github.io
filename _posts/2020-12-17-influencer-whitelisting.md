Influencer whitelisting is a marketing strategy that involves partnering with influencers, or individuals with a large following on social media or other platforms, to promote your product or service. By building relationships with influencers and inviting them to join a whitelist, you can leverage their credibility and reach to boost your sales and increase brand awareness.

One of the main benefits of influencer whitelisting is that it allows you to tap into the trusted relationships that influencers have with their followers. Influencers often have a loyal following of individuals who trust their opinions and recommendations, and by partnering with them, you can gain access to this audience and potentially convert them into paying customers.

In addition to increasing your reach, influencer whitelisting can also help to boost your sales by increasing the credibility and perceived value of your product or service. When an influencer endorses your product, it can be perceived as a stamp of approval, which can help to boost consumer confidence and increase the likelihood of a purchase.

To be effective, it is important to carefully select the influencers you work with and ensure that they are a good fit for your brand. Look for influencers who have a genuine interest in your product or service and who are able to authentically promote it to their followers.

Another key to success with influencer whitelisting is to offer incentives to influencers to encourage them to promote your product or service. This could include offering them free products, discounts, or other perks.

In conclusion, influencer whitelisting is an effective marketing strategy that can help boost your sales and increase brand awareness. By partnering with influencers and offering incentives, you can tap into their credibility and reach to drive traffic and conversions.
## What is influencer whitelisting?
Influencer whitelisting is a process in which a company or organization creates a list of approved influencers who are allowed to promote their products or services. This list is typically created to ensure that the company's brand and reputation are protected by only working with influencers who have a positive reputation and align with the company's values and messaging.

Influencer whitelisting is often used in social media marketing, where companies use influencers with large followings to promote their products or services to a wider audience. By creating a whitelist of approved influencers, companies can ensure that the influencers they work with meet certain criteria and are not likely to damage the company's reputation through their actions or content.

In order to be whitelisted, influencers typically have to go through a vetting process, which may include providing information about their followers, engagement rates, and content history. Companies may also require influencers to sign a contract or agreement outlining the terms of their partnership and any requirements for content creation or promotion.
## Don't confuse influencer whitelisting with paid partnerships
Influencers typically collaborate with brands through paid partnerships and sponsored posts on their profiles, or by sharing products that have been gifted to them by brands. 

It is often required by law for influencers to disclose any paid content by using hashtags such as #sponsored or #gifted or by explicitly stating the partnership at the beginning of the post. You can find more information about branded content policies on Facebook and Instagram. 

In most cases, sponsored influencer content will include a declaration of the partnership at the top of the post.

Influencer whitelisting is not the same as running a paid partnership or using influencer-generated content for branded ads. 
Here is an example of a brand using an influencer for their sponsored content, which is not whitelisting:

When it comes to whitelisting, the brand posts as the influencer, and the post appears as follows:
![This IS whitelisting!](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60c334e72012f37063378d4b/62c2ea873500c64946684e07_0xPxRs2ufXNObUQTBe6qL0BgAe6p_rdgaUWUE1Jd7iIozgY95Qfs70SForC5UHpY7dhxySTu7SojaYHn9DbkKuSPh4x4ANFTyFle5X4w6IioTZEVbgS1W4eoAaiO6OGqS2iWV7fe-FBqCBRfOw.jpeg)
In this scenario, the brand is sponsoring a post about a tablet on the influencer's Instagram account, but it only appears on the user's timeline and not on the influencer's profile. This is an example of whitelisting.

Which brings us to our next question…
## What is dark posting?
Dark posting involves a brand running ads using an influencer's handle, but these posts do not appear on the influencer's feed. Instead, they are only visible to a specific target audience. This means that not all of the influencer's followers will see a dark post, only those who are part of the targeted group. 

One advantage of dark posting is that it allows a brand to test different versions of a post and target them to different audiences without cluttering the influencer's feed. It is also a way for brands to leverage an influencer's credibility without using organic posts with sponsored hashtags, as organic content typically only reaches about 5.5% of someone's followers. By putting money behind dark posts, a brand can ensure that more people will see them.
